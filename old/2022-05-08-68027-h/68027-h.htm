to render the navy of the republic popular and respectable,
the gallant seaman whose name is placed
at the head of this article is entitled to a conspicuous
place; equally on account of his services, his professional
skill, and his personal merit. Although his
connection with the marine, created under the constitution
of 1789, was of short continuance, it left a
durable impression on the service; and, if we look
back to the dark period of the Revolution, we find
him contending in some of the fiercest combats of the
period, always with heroism, and not unfrequently
with success. Circumstances, too, have connected
his renown with one of the most remarkable naval
battles on record; a distinction of itself which fully
entitles him to a high place among those who have
fought and bled for the independence of their country,
in stations of subordinate authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Richard Dale was born in the colony of Virginia,
on the 6th November, 1756. His birthplace was in
the county of Norfolk, and not distant from the well
known port of the same name. His parents were
native Americans, of respectable standing, though
of rather reduced circumstances. His father, dying
early, left a widow with five children, of whom the
subject of this memoir was the eldest. Some time
after the death of his father, his mother contracted a
second marriage with a gentleman of the name of
Cooper, among the issue of which were two well
known ship-masters of Philadelphia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Young Dale manifested an inclination for the sea
at a very early period of life. The distrust of a
parental control that has no foundation in nature, and
which is apt to be regarded with jealousy, stimulated
if it did not quicken this desire, and we find him at
the tender age of twelve, or in 1768, making a voyage
between Norfolk and Liverpool, in a vessel commanded
by one of his own uncles. On his return
home, he appears to have passed nearly a twelve-month
on shore; but his desire to become a sailor
still continuing, in the spring of 1770 he was regularly
apprenticed to a respectable merchant and
ship-owner, of the borough of Norfolk, named Newton.
From this moment his fortune in life was cast,
and he continued devotedly employed in the profession
until his enterprise, prudence and gallantry enabled
him finally to retire with credit, an unblemished
name, and a competency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During his apprenticeship, Dale appears to have
been, most of the time, employed in the West India
trade. Every sailor has his chances and hair-breadth
escapes, and our young mariner met with two, at
that period of his life, which may be thought worthy
of notice. On one occasion he fell from the spars
stowed on the belfry into the vessel’s hold, hitting the
kelson, a distance of near twenty feet; escaping, however,
without material injury. A much greater risk
was incurred on another. While the vessel to which
he belonged was running off the wind, with a stiff
breeze, Dale was accidentally knocked overboard
by the jib sheets, and was not picked up without
great difficulty. He was an hour in the water, sustaining
himself by swimming, and he ever spoke of
the incident as one of more peril than any other in a
perilous career.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When nineteen, or in 1775, Dale had risen to the
station of chief mate on board a large brig belonging
to his owner. In this situation he appears to have
remained industriously engaged during the few first
months of the struggle for independence; the active
warfare not having yet extended itself as far south as
his part of the country. Early in 1776, however, the
aspect of things began to change, and it is probable
that the interruption to commerce rendered him the
master of his own movements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Virginia, in common with most of the larger and
more maritime colonies, had a sort of marine of its
own; more especially anterior to the Declaration of
Independence. It consisted principally of bay craft,
and was employed in the extensive estuaries and
rivers of that commonwealth. On board of one of
these light cruisers Dale was entered as a lieutenant,
in the early part of the memorable year 1776. While
in this service, he was sent a short distance for some
guns, in a river craft; but falling in with a tender of
the Liverpool frigate, which ship was then cruising
on the Cape Henry station, he was captured and carried
into Norfolk. These tenders were usually smart
little cruisers, another, belonging to the same frigate,
having been taken shortly before, by the U. S. brig
Lexington, after a sharp and bloody conflict. Resistance
in the case of Dale was consequently out of the
question, his capture having been altogether a matter
of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On reaching Norfolk, our young officer was thrown
on board a prison-ship. Here he found himself in
the midst of those whom it was the fashion to call
“loyal subjects.” Many of them were his old school-mates
and friends. Among the latter was a young
man of the name of Bridges Gutteridge, a sailor like
himself, and one who possessed his entire confidence.
Mr. Gutteridge, who it is believed subsequently took
part with his countrymen himself, was then employed
by the British, in the waters of the Chesapeake, actually
commanding a tender in their service. The
quarrel was still recent; and honorable, as well as
honest men, under the opinions which prevailed in
that day, might well be divided as to its merits. Mr.
Gutteridge had persuaded himself he was pursuing
the proper course. Entertaining such opinions, he
earnestly set about the attempt of making a convert
of his captured friend. The usual arguments, touching
the sacred rights of the king—himself merely a
legalized usurper, by the way, if any validity is to
be given to the claims of hereditary right to the
crown—and the desperate nature of the “rebel
cause,” were freely and strenuously used, until Dale
began to waver in his faith. In the end, he yielded
and consented to accompany his friend in a cruise
against the vessels of the state. This occurred in
the month of May, and, hostilities beginning now to
be active, the tender soon fell in with a party of
Americans, in some pilot boats, that were employed
in the Rappahannock. A warm engagement ensued,
in which the tender was compelled to run, after
meeting with a heavy loss. It was a rude initiation
into the mysteries of war, the fighting being of a
desperate, and almost of a personal character. This
was one of those combats that often occurred about
this period, and in those waters, most of them being
close and sanguinary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this affair, Dale received a severe wound, having
been hit in the head by a musket ball; with this
wound he was confined several weeks at Norfolk,
during which time he had abundance of leisure to
reflect on the false step into which he had been persuaded,
and to form certain healthful resolutions for
the future. To use his own words, in speaking of
this error of his early life, he determined “never
again to put himself in the way of the bullets of his
own country.” This resolution, however, it was necessary
to conceal, if he would escape the horrors
of a prison-ship, and he “bided his time,” fully determined
to take service again under the American
flag, at the first fitting opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the peculiar state of the two countries at the
time, and with the doubtful and contested morality of
the misunderstanding, there was nothing extraordinary
in this incident. Similar circumstances occurred
to many men, who, with the best intentions and
purest motives, saw, or fancied they saw, reasons
for changing sides in what, in their eyes, was strictly
a family quarrel. In the case of Dale, however, the
feature most worthy of comment was the singleness
of mind and simple integrity with which he used to
confess his own error, together with the manner in
which he finally became a convert to the true political
faith. No narrative of the life of this respectable
seaman would be complete, without including
this temporary wavering of purpose; nor would any
delineation of his character be just, that did not point
out the candor and sincerity with which he, in after
life, admitted his fault.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale was only in his twentieth year when he received
this instructive lesson from the “bullets of his
countrymen.” From that time, he took good care
not to place himself again in their way, going, in
June or July, to Bermuda, on a more peaceable expedition,
in company with William Gutteridge, a
relative of his beguiling friend. On the return passage,
the vessel was captured by the Lexington, the
brig just mentioned, then a successful cruiser, under
the orders of Capt. John Barry; an officer who subsequently
died at the head of the service. This occurred
just after the Declaration of Independence,
and Dale immediately offered himself as a volunteer
under the national flag. He was received and rated
as a midshipman within a few hours of his capture.
This was the commencement of Dale’s service in
the regular navy of his native country. It was also
the commencement of his acquaintance with the distinguished
commander of the Lexington, whose
friendship and respect he enjoyed down to the day of
the latter’s death. While the brig was out, our midshipman
had another narrow escape from death,
having, together with several others, been struck
senseless by lightning during a severe thunder storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Barry made the capture just mentioned near the
end of his cruise, and he soon after went into Philadelphia,
which place Dale now saw for the first time.
Here Barry left the Lexington to take command of
the Effingham 28, a ship that never got to sea, leaving
our new midshipman in the brig. Capt. Hallock
was Barry’s successor, and he soon rated Dale, by
this time an active and skilful seaman, a master’s
mate. Early in the autumn, the Lexington sailed for
Cape François, on special duty. On her return, in
the month of December, she fell in with the Pearl
frigate,<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> and was captured without resistance, carrying
an armament of only a few fours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As it was blowing very fresh at the moment this
capture was made, the Pearl took out of the prize
four or five officers, threw a small crew on board,
and directed the brig to follow her. By some accounts
Dale was left in the Lexington, while by
others he was not. A succinct history of the events
of his life, written by a connection under his own
eye, and which is now before us, gives the latter
version of the affair, and is probably the true one.
At all events, the remaining officers and crew of
the Lexington rose upon the captors in the course of
the night, retook the brig, and carried her into Baltimore.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The English landed several of their prisoners on
Cape Henlopen, in January, 1777, under some arrangement
that cannot now be explained, though
probably it was connected with an exchange for the
men taken and carried away in the prize. Among
these was Dale, who made the best of his way to
Philadelphia, when he received orders to proceed to
Baltimore; which he obeyed, and rejoined his brig,
the command of which had now been transferred to
Capt. Henry Johnston.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next service on which the Lexington was employed
was in the European seas. In March, she
sailed from Baltimore for Bordeaux, with despatches.
On her arrival, this brig was attached to a small
squadron under the orders of Capt. Lambert Wickes,
who was in the Reprisal 16, having under his command
also the Dolphin 10, Capt. Samuel Nicholson.
This force of little vessels accomplished a bold and
destructive cruise, making the entire circuit of Ireland,
though it was eventually chased into a French
port by a line-of-battle ship. Its object was the interception
of certain linen-ships, which it missed;
its success, however, in the main, was such as to
excite great alarm among the English merchants,
and to produce warm remonstrances to France, from
their government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time France was not at war with England,
although she secretly favored and aided the cause of
the revolted colonies. The appearance of American
cruisers in the narrow seas, however, gave rise to
so many complaints, as to induce the French government,
in preference to pushing matters to extremities,
temporarily to sequester the vessels. The Lexington
was included in this measure, having been detained
in port more than two months; or, until security was
given that she would quit the European seas. This
was done, and the brig got to sea again on the 18th
September, 1777.<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is probable that the recent difficulties had some
effect on the amount of the military stores on board
all three of the American vessels. At all events, it
is certain that the Lexington sailed with a short supply
of both powder and shot, particularly of the latter.
The very next day she made an English cutter lying-to,
which was approached with a confidence that
could only have proceeded from a mistake as to her
character. This cutter proved to be a man-of-war,
called the Alert, commanded by Lieutenant, afterward
Admiral Bazely, having a strong crew on
board, and an armament of ten sixes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the action that ensued, and which was particularly
well fought on the part of the enemy, the Americans
were, in a measure, taken by surprise. So
little were the latter prepared for the conflict, that
not a match was ready when the engagement commenced,
and several broadsides were fired by discharging
muskets at the vents of the guns. The firing
killed the wind, and there being considerable sea on,
the engagement became very protracted, during
which the Lexington expended most of her ammunition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After a cannonading of two hours, believing his
antagonist to be too much crippled to follow, and
aware of his own inability to continue the action
much longer, Capt. Johnston made sail, and left the
cutter, under favor of a breeze that just then sprung
up. The Lexington left the Alert rapidly at first, but
the latter having bent new sails, and being the faster
vessel, in the course of three or four hours succeeded
in getting alongside again, and of renewing the engagement.
This second struggle lasted an hour, the
fighting being principally on one side. After the
Lexington had thrown her last shot, had broken up
and used all the iron that could be made available as
substitutes, and had three of her officers and several
of her men slain, besides many wounded, Capt.
Johnston struck his colors. The first lieutenant,
marine officer, and master of the Lexington were
among the slain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By this accident Dale became a prisoner for the
third time. This occurred when he wanted just fifty
days of being twenty-one years old. On this occasion,
however, he escaped unhurt, though the combat
had been both fierce and sanguinary. The prize
was taken into Plymouth, and her officers, after undergoing
a severe examination, in order to ascertain
their birthplaces, were all thrown into Mill Prison,
on a charge of high treason. Here they found the
common men; the whole being doomed to a rigorous
and painful confinement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Either from policy or cupidity, the treatment received
by the Americans, in this particular prison,
was of a cruel and oppressive character. There is
no apology for excessive rigor, or, indeed, for any
constraint beyond that which is necessary to security,
toward an uncondemned man. Viewed as mere
prisoners of war, the Americans might claim the
usual indulgence; viewed as subjects still to be tried,
they were rightfully included in that healthful maxim
of the law, which assumes that all are innocent until
they are proved to be guilty. So severe were the
privations of the Americans on this occasion, however,
that, in pure hunger, they caught a stray dog
one day, skinned, cooked and ate him, to satisfy their
cravings for food. Their situation at length attracted
the attention of the liberal; statements of their wants
were laid before the public, and an appeal was made
to the humanity of the English nation. This is always
an efficient mode of obtaining assistance, and the
large sum of sixteen thousand pounds was soon
raised; thereby relieving the wants of the sufferers,
and effectually effacing the stain from the national
escutcheon; by demonstrating that the sufferers
found a generous sympathy in the breasts of the
public. But man requires more than food and
warmth. Although suffering no longer from actual
want and brutal maltreatment, Dale and his companions
pined for liberty—to be once more fighting the
battles of their country. Seeing no hopes of an exchange,
a large party of the prisoners determined to
make an attempt at escape. A suitable place was
selected, and a hole under a wall was commenced.
The work required secrecy and time. The earth
was removed, little by little, in the pockets of the
captives, care being had to conceal the place, until a
hole of sufficient size was made to permit the body
of a man to pass through. It was a tedious process,
for the only opportunity which occurred to empty
their pockets, was while the Americans were exercising
on the walls of their prison, for a short period
of each day. By patience and perseverance they
accomplished their purpose, however, every hour
dreading exposure and defeat.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When all was ready, Capt. Johnston, most of his
officers, and several of his crew, or, as many as
were in the secret, passed through the hole, and
escaped. This was in February, 1778. The party
wandered about the country in company, and by
night, for more than a week; suffering all sorts of
privations, until it was resolved to take the wiser
course of separating. Dale, accompanied by one
other, found his way to London, hotly pursued. At
one time the two lay concealed under some straw in
an out-house, while the premises were searched by
those who were in quest of them. On reaching London,
Dale and his companion immediately got on
board a vessel about to sail for Dunkirk. A press-gang
unluckily took this craft in its rounds, and suspecting
the true objects of the fugitives, they were
arrested, and, their characters being ascertained,
they were sent back to Mill Prison in disgrace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the commencement of a captivity far
more tedious than the former. In the first place they
were condemned to forty days’ confinement in the
black hole, as the punishment for the late escape;
and, released from this durance, they were deprived
of many of their former indulgences. Dale himself
took his revenge in singing “rebel songs,” and paid
a second visit to the black hole, as the penalty. This
state of things, with alternations of favor and punishment,
continued quite a year, when Dale, singly,
succeeded in again effecting his great object of getting
free.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mode in which this second escape was made
is known, but the manner by which he procured the
means he refused to his dying day to disclose. At
all events, he obtained a full suit of British uniform,
attired in which, and seizing a favorable moment, he
boldly walked past all the sentinels, and got off.
That some one was connected with his escape who
might suffer by his revelations is almost certain; and
it is a trait in his character worthy of notice, that he
kept this secret, with scrupulous fidelity, for forty-seven
years. It is not known that he ever divulged
it even to any individual of his own family.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rendered wary by experience, Dale now proceeded
with great address and caution. He probably
had money, as well as clothes. At all events, he
went to London, found means to procure a passport,
and left the country for France, unsuspected and undetected.
On reaching a friendly soil, he hastened
to l’Orient, and joined the force then equipping under
Paul Jones, in his old rank of a master’s mate.
Here he was actively employed for some months,
affording the commodore an opportunity to ascertain
his true merits, when they met with something like
their just reward. As Dale was now near twenty-three,
and an accomplished seaman, Jones, after
trying several less competent persons, procured a
commission for him from the commissioners, and
made him the first lieutenant of his own ship, the
justly celebrated Bon Homme Richard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not our intention, in this article, to enter any
farther into the incidents of this well known cruise,
than is necessary to complete the present subject.
Dale does not appear in any prominent situation,
though always discharging the duties of his responsible
station, with skill and credit, until the squadron
appeared off Leith, with the intention of seizing that
town—the port of Edinburgh—and of laying it under
contribution. On this occasion, our lieutenant was
selected to command the boats that were to land,
a high compliment to so young a man, as coming
from one of the character of Paul Jones. Every
thing was ready, Dale had received his final orders,
and was in the very act of proceeding to the ship’s
side to enter his boat, when a heavy squall struck the
vessels, and induced an order for the men to come
on deck, and assist in shortening sail. The vessels
were compelled to bear up before it, to save their
spars; this carried them out of the firth; and, a gale
succeeding, the enterprise was necessarily abandoned.
This gale proved so heavy, that one of the
prizes actually foundered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This attempt of Jones, while it is admitted to have
greatly alarmed the coast, has often been pronounced
rash and inconsiderate. Such was not the opinion
of Dale. A man of singular moderation in his modes
of thinking, and totally without bravado, it was his
conviction that the effort would have been crowned
with success. He assured the writer, years after the
occurrence, that he was about to embark in the expedition
with feelings of high confidence, and that he
believed nothing but the inopportune intervention of
the squall stood between Jones and a triumphant
<span class='it'>coup de main</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A few days later, Jones made a secret proposal to
his officers, which some affirm was to burn the shipping
at North Shields, but which the commanders of
two of his vessels strenuously opposed, in consequence
of which the project was abandoned. The
commodore himself, in speaking of the manner in
which this and other similar propositions were received
by his subordinates, extolled the ardor invariably
manifested by the young men, among whom
Dale was one of the foremost. Had it rested with
them, the attempts at least would all have been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 19th September occurred the celebrated
battle between the Serapis and the Bon Homme
Richard. As the proper place to enter fully into the
details of that murderous combat will be in the biography
of Jones, we shall confine ourselves at present
to incidents with which the subject of this
memoir was more immediately connected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Bon Homme Richard had finally sailed on
this cruise with only two proper sea-lieutenants on
board her. There was a third officer of the name of
Lunt, who has been indifferently called a lieutenant
and the sailing-master, but who properly filled the
latter station. This gentleman had separated from
the ship in a fog, on the coast of Ireland, while in
the pursuit of some deserters, and never rejoined
the squadron. Another person of the same name,
and believed to be the brother of the master, was the
second lieutenant. He was sent in a pilot-boat, accompanied
by a midshipman and several men, to
capture a vessel in sight, before Jones made the Baltic
fleet coming round Flamborough Head. This
party was not able to return to the Bon Homme
Richard, until after the battle had terminated. In
consequence of these two circumstances, each so
novel in itself, the American frigate fought this
bloody and arduous combat with only one officer on
board her, of the rank of a sea-lieutenant, who
was Dale. This is the reason why the latter is so
often mentioned as <span class='it'>the</span> lieutenant of the Bon Homme
Richard, during that memorable fight. The fact rendered
his duties more arduous and diversified, and
entitles him to the greater credit for their proper
performance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale was stationed on the gun-deck, where of
course he commanded in chief, though it appears
that his proper personal division was the forward
guns. Until the ships got foul of each other, this
brought him particularly into the hottest of the work;
the Serapis keeping much on the bows, or ahead of
the Bon Homme Richard. It is known that Jones was
much pleased with his deportment, which, in truth,
was every way worthy of his own. When the alarm
was given that the ship was sinking, Dale went below
himself to ascertain the real state of the water, and
his confident and fearless report cheered the men to
renewed exertions. Shortly after, the supply of powder
was stopped, when our lieutenant again quitted
his quarters to inquire into the cause. On reaching
the magazine passage he was told by the sentinels
that they had closed the ingress, on account of a
great number of strange and foreign faces that they
saw around them. On further inquiry, Dale discovered
that the master at arms, of his own head, had
let loose all the prisoners—more than a hundred in
number—under the belief that the ship was sinking.
Dale soon saw the danger which might ensue, but
finding the English much alarmed at the supposed
condition of the ship, he succeeded in mustering
them, and setting them at work at the pumps, where,
by their exertions, they probably prevented the apprehended
calamity. For some time, at the close of
the action, all his guns being rendered useless, Dale
was employed principally in this important service.
There is no question that without some such succor,
the Richard would have gone down much earlier
than she did. It is a singular feature of this every-way
extraordinary battle, that here were Englishmen,
zealously employed in aiding the efforts of their
enemies, under the cool control of a collected and
observant officer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At length the cheerful intelligence was received
that the enemy had struck. Dale went on deck, and
immediately demanded Jones’ permission to take
possession of the prize. It was granted, and had he
never manifested any other act of personal intrepidity,
his promptitude on this occasion, and the
manner in which he went to work, to attain his purpose,
would have shown him to be a man above personal
considerations, when duty or honor pointed out
his course. The main-yard of the Serapis was hanging
a-cock-bill, over the side of the American ship.
The brace was shot away, and the pendant hung
within reach. Seizing the latter, Dale literally swung
himself off, and alighted alone on the quarter-deck of
the Serapis. Here he found no one but the brave
Pierson, who had struck his own flag; but the men
below were still ignorant of the act. We may form
an opinion of the risk that the young man ran, in
thus boarding his enemy at night, and in the confusion
of such a combat, for the English were still
firing below, by the fact that Mr. Mayrant, a young
man of South Carolina, and a midshipman of the
Bon Homme Richard, who led a party after the
lieutenant, was actually run through the thigh by a
boarding pike, and by the hands of a man in the
waist below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first act of Dale, on getting on the quarter
deck of the Serapis, was to direct her captain to go
on board the American ship. While thus employed,
the English first lieutenant came up from below, and
finding that the Americans had ceased their fire, he
demanded if they had struck. “No, sir,” answered
Dale, “it is this ship that has struck, and you are my
prisoner.” An appeal to Capt. Pierson confirming
this, the English lieutenant offered to go below and
silence the remaining guns of the Serapis. To this
Dale objected, and had both the officers passed on
board the Bon Homme Richard. In a short time,
the English below were sent from their guns, and
full possession was obtained of the prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As more men were soon sent from the Bon Homme
Richard, the two ships were now separated, the
Richard making sail, and Jones ordering Dale to follow
with the prize. A sense of fatigue had come
over the latter, in consequence of the reaction of so
much excitement and so great exertions, and he took
a seat on the binnacle. Here he issued an order to
brace the head yards aback, and to put the helm
down. Wondering that the ship did not pay off, he
directed that the wheel-ropes should be examined. It
was reported that they were not injured, and that the
helm was hard down. Astonished to find the ship
immovable under such circumstances, there being
a light breeze, Dale sprang upon his feet, and then
discovered, for the first time, that he had been severely
wounded, by a splinter, in the foot and ankle.
The hurt, now that he was no longer sustained by the
excitement of battle, deprived him of the use of his
leg, and he fell. Just at this moment, Mr. Lunt, the
officer who had been absent in the pilot-boat, reached
the Richard, and Dale was forced to give up to him
the command of the prize. The cause of the Serapis’
not minding her helm was the fact that Capt.
Pierson had dropped an anchor under foot when the
two ships got foul; a circumstance of which the
Americans were ignorant until this moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale was some time laid up with his wound, but
he remained with Jones in his old station of first
lieutenant, accompanying that officer, in the Alliance,
from the Texel to l’Orient. In the controversy which
ensued between the commodore and Landais, our
lieutenant took sides warmly with the first, and even
offered to head a party to recover the Alliance, by
force. This measure not being resorted to, he remained
with Jones, and finally sailed with him for
America, as his first lieutenant, in the Ariel 20, a
ship lent to the Americans, by the King of France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Ariel quitted port in October, 1780, but encountered
a tremendous gale of wind off the Penmarks.
Losing her masts, she was compelled to
return to refit. On this occasion Dale, in his responsible
situation of first lieutenant, showed all the
coolness of his character, and the resources of a
thorough seaman. The tempest was almost a hurricane,
and of extraordinary violence. The Ariel
sailed a second time about the commencement of the
year 1781, and reached Philadelphia on the 18th
February. During the passage home, she had a
short action, in the night, with a heavy British letter-of-marque,
that gave her name as the Triumph; and
which ship is said to have struck, but to have made
her escape by treachery. Jones, who was greedy of
glory, even fancied that his enemy was a vessel of
war, and that he had captured a vessel of at least
equal force. This was not Dale’s impression. He
spoke of the affair to the writer of this article, as one
of no great moment, even questioning whether their
antagonist struck at all; giving it as his belief
she was a quick-working and fast-sailing letter-of-marque.
He distinctly stated that she got off by out-manœuvring
the Ariel, which vessel was badly manned,
and had an exceedingly mixed and disaffected
crew. It is worthy of remark that, while two articles,
enumerating the services of Dale, have been
written by gentlemen connected with himself, and
possessing his confidence, neither mentions this affair;
a proof, in itself, that Dale considered it one of little
moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The account which Dale always gave of the meeting
between the Ariel and Triumph—admitting such
to have been the name of the English ship—so different
from that which has found its way into various
publications, on the representation of other actors in
that affair, is illustrative of the character of the man.
Simple of mind, totally without exaggeration, and a
lover, as well as a practicer, of severe truth, he was
a man whose representations might be fully relied
on. Even in his account of the extraordinary combat
between the Richard and Serapis, he stripped the
affair of all its romance, and of every thing that was
wonderful; rendering the whole clear, simple and
intelligible as his own thoughts. The only narratives
of that battle, worthy of a seaman, have been written
rigidly after his explanations, which leave it a bloody
and murderous fight, but one wholly without the
marvelous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On his arrival at Philadelphia, after an absence of
four years, more than one of which had been spent
in prison, Dale was just twenty-four years and two
months old. He was now regularly put on the list
of lieutenants, by the marine committee of Congress;
his former authority proceeding from the agents of
the government in Europe. It is owing to this circumstance
that the register of government places
him so low as a lieutenant. Dale now parted from
Paul Jones, with whom he had served near two
years; and that, too, in some of the most trying
scenes of the latter’s life. The commodore was
anxious to take his favorite lieutenant with him to
the America 74; but the latter declined the service,
under the impression it would be a long time before
the ship got to sea. He judged right, the America
being transferred to the French in the end, and Jones
himself never again sailing under the American flag.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name of Dale will inseparably be connected
with the battle of the Richard and Serapis. His
prominent position and excellent conduct entitle him
to this mark of distinction, and it says much for the
superior, when it confers fame to have been “Paul
Jones’ first lieutenant.” We smile, however, at the
legends of the day, when we recall the account of
the “Lieutenants Grubb” and other heroes of romance,
who have been made to figure in the histories
of that renowned combat, and place them in contrast
with the truth-loving, sincere, moral and respectable
subject of this memoir. The sword which Louis
XVI. bestowed on Jones, for this victory, passed into
the hands of Dale, and is now the property of a gallant
son, a fitting mark of the services of the father,
on the glorious occasion it commemorates.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale was employed on board a schooner that was
manned from the Ariel, after reaching Philadelphia,
and sent down the Delaware to convoy certain public
stores. The following June, he joined the Trumbull
28, Captain Nicholson, as her first lieutenant. The
Trumbull left the capes of the Delaware on the 8th
August, 1781, being chased off the land by three of
the enemy’s cruisers. The weather was squally and
night set in dark. In endeavoring to avoid her pursuers,
the Trumbull found herself alongside of the
largest, a frigate of thirty-two guns, and an action
was fought under the most unfavorable circumstances.
The Trumbull’s fore-topmast was hanging over, or
rather through her forecastle, her crew was disorganized,
and the vessel herself in a state of no preparation
for a conflict with an equal force; much
less with that actually opposed to her. The officers
made great exertions, and maintained an action of
more than an hour, when the colors of the American
ship were struck to the Iris 32, and Monk 18. The
former of these vessels had been the American frigate
Hancock, and the latter was subsequently captured
in the Delaware, by Barney in the Hyder Ally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was the fourth serious affair in which Dale
had been engaged that war, and the fourth time he
had been captured. As he was hurt also in this
battle, it made the third of his wounds. His confinement,
however, was short, and the treatment not a
subject of complaint. He was taken into New York,
paroled on Long Island, and exchanged in November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No new service offering in a marine which, by
this time, had lost most of its ships, Dale obtained a
furlough, and joined a large letter-of-marque called
the Queen of France, that carried twelve guns, as
her first officer. Soon after he was appointed to the
command of the same vessel. In the spring of 1782,
this ship, in company with several other letters-of-marque,
sailed for France, making many captures
by the way. The ship of Dale, however, parted
from the fleet, and, falling in with an English privateer
of fourteen guns, a severe engagement followed,
in which both parties were much cut up; they parted
by mutual consent. Dale did not get back to Philadelphia
until February of the succeeding year, or
until about the time that peace was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In common with most of the officers of the navy,
Lieutenant Dale was disbanded, as soon as the war
ceased. He was now in the twenty-seventh year of
his age, with a perfect knowledge of his profession,
in which he had passed more than half his life, a
high reputation for his rank, a courage that had often
been tried, a body well scarred, a character beyond
reproach, and not altogether without “money in his
purse.” Under the circumstances, he naturally determined
to follow up his fortunes in the line in
which he had commenced his career. He became
part owner of a large ship, and sailed in her for
London, December, 1783, in the station of master.
After this, he embarked successfully in the East
India trade, in the same character, commanding
several of the finest ships out of the country. In this
manner he accumulated a respectable fortune, and
began to take his place among the worthies of the
land in a new character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In September, 1791, Mr. Dale was married to
Dorothy Crathorne, the daughter of another respectable
ship-master of Philadelphia, and then a ward
of Barry’s. With this lady he passed the remainder
of his days, she surviving him as his widow, and dying
some years later than himself. No change in his pursuits
occurred until 1794, when the new government
commenced the organization of another marine, which
has resulted in that which the country now possesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale was one of the six captains appointed under
the law of 1794, that directed the construction of as
many frigates, with a view to resist the aggressions
of Algiers. Each of the new captains was ordered
to superintend the construction of one of the frigates,
and Dale, who was fifth in rank, was directed to
assume the superintendence of the one laid down at
Norfolk, virtually the place of his nativity. This
ship was intended to be a frigate of the first class,
but, by some mistake in her moulds, she proved in
the end to be the smallest of the six vessels then
built. It was the unfortunate Chesapeake, a vessel
that never was in a situation to reflect much credit
on the service. Her construction, however, was
deferred, in consequence of an arrangement with
Algiers, and her captain was put on furlough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale now returned to the China trade, in which he
continued until the spring of 1798. The last vessel
he commanded was called the Ganges. She was a
fine, fast ship, and the state of our relations with
France requiring a hurried armament, the government
bought this vessel, in common with several
others, put an armament of suitable guns in her, with
a full crew, gave her to Dale, and ordered her on the
coast as a regular cruiser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In consequence of this arrangement, Capt. Dale
was the first officer who ever got to sea under the
pennant of the present navy. He sailed in May,
1798, and was followed by the Constellation and
Delaware in a few days. The service of Dale in
his new capacity was short, however, in consequence
of some questions relating to rank. The
captains appointed in 1794 claimed their old places,
and, it being uncertain what might be the final decision
of the government, as there were many aspirants,
Dale declined serving until the matter was
determined. In May, 1799, he sailed for Canton
again, in command of a strong letter-of-marque, under
a furlough. On his return from this voyage he
found his place on the list settled according to his
own views of justice and honor, and reported himself
for service. Nothing offered, however, until the
difficulties with France were arranged; but, in
May, 1801, he was ordered to take command of a
squadron of observation about to be sent to the
Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale now hoisted his broad pennant, for the first
and only time, and assumed the title by which he was
known for the rest of his days. He was in the prime
of life, being in his forty-fifth year, of an active,
manly frame, and had every prospect before him of
a long and honorable service. The ships put under
his orders were the President 44, Capt. James Barron;
Philadelphia 38, Capt. Samuel Barron; Essex
32, Capt. William Bainbridge; and Enterprise 12,
Lieut. Com. Sterrett. A better appointed, or a better
commanded force, probably never sailed from America.
But there was little to do, under the timid
policy and defective laws of the day. War was not
supposed to exist, although hostilities did; and vessels
were sent into foreign seas with crews shipped for a
period that would scarcely allow of a vessel’s being
got into proper order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The squadron sailed June 1st, 1801, and reached
Gibraltar July 1st. The Philadelphia blockaded the
Tripolitan admiral, with two cruisers, in Gibraltar,
while the other vessels went aloft. A sharp action
occurred between the Enterprise and a Tripolitan of
equal force, in which the latter was compelled to
submit, but was allowed to go into her own port
again, for want of legal authority to detain her. Dale
appeared off Tripoli, endeavored to negotiate a little
about an exchange of prisoners, and did blockade
the port; but his orders fettered him in a way to
prevent any serious enterprises. In a word, no circumstances
occurred to allow the commodore to
show his true character, except as it was manifested
in his humanity, prudence and dignity. As a superior,
he obtained the profound respect of all under his
orders, and to this day his name is mentioned with
regard by those who then served under him. It is
thought that this squadron did much toward establishing
the high discipline of the marine. In one instance
only had Dale an opportunity of manifesting his high
personal and professional qualities. The President
struck a rock in quitting Port Mahon, and for some
hours she was thought to be in imminent danger of
foundering. Dale assumed the command, and one of
his lieutenants, himself subsequently a flag officer of
rare seamanship and merit, has often recounted to
the writer his admiration of the commodore’s coolness,
judgment, and nerve, on so trying an occasion.
The ship was carried to Toulon, blowing a gale,
and, on examination, it was found that she was only
saved from destruction by the skilful manner in which
the wood ends had been secured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The vigilance of Dale was so great, however, and
his dispositions so skilful, that the Tripolitans made
no captures while he commanded in those seas. In
March, 1802, he sailed for home, under his orders,
reaching Hampton Roads in April, after a cruise of
about ten months. The succeeding autumn, Com.
Dale received an order to hold himself in readiness
to resume the command from which he had just returned.
Ever ready to serve his country, when it
could be done with honor, he would cheerfully have
made his preparations accordingly, but, by the order
itself, he ascertained that he was to be sent out without
a captain in his own ship. This, agreeably to
the notions he entertained, was a descent in the scale
of rank, and he declined serving on such terms.
There being no alternative between obedience and
resignation, he chose the latter, and quitted the navy.
At this time, he was the third captain on the list, and
it is no more than justice to say, that he stood second
to no other in the public estimation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dale never went to sea again. Possessed of an
ample fortune, and possessing the esteem of all who
knew him, he commanded the respect of those with
whom he differed in opinion touching the question
which drove him from the navy. With the latter he
never quarreled, for, at the proper period, he gave
to it his two elder sons. To the last he retained his
interest in its success, and his care of mariners, in
general, extended far beyond the interests of this life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many years previously to his death, Com. Dale
entered into full communion with the Protestant
Episcopal Church, of which he proved a consistent
and pious member. Under the newly awakened
feelings which induced this step, he was the originater
of a Mariner’s Church, in Philadelphia, attending
it in person, every Sunday afternoon, for a long
succession of years. He was as free with his purse,
too, as with his time; and his charities, though properly
concealed, were believed to be large and discriminating.
With some it may be deemed a matter
of moment, with all it should be a proof of the estimation
in which Dale was held by certainly a very
respectable part of his fellow citizens, that he was
named to be the first president of the Washington
Benevolent Society; an association that soon degenerated
to serve the ends of party politics, whatever
may have been the design that influenced the few
with which it originated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evening of the life of Dale was singularly
peaceful and happy. It was as calm as its morning
had been tempestuous. It is true he had to weep
for the loss of his first-born son, a noble youth, who
died of wounds received in the action between his
old ship, the President, and a British squadron; but
he had given the young man to his country, and knew
how to bear up under the privation. He died, himself,
in the seventieth year of his age, in his dwelling at
Philadelphia, February 26th, 1826; departing in peace
with God and man, as he fondly trusted himself, and
as those who survive have every reason to hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By his marriage with Miss Crathorne, Com. Dale
had several children, five of whom lived to become
men and women, viz. three sons and two daughters.
Of the former, Richard, the eldest, fell, at an early
age, a midshipman on board the President. John
Montgomery, the second, is now a commander in the
navy, having served with Warrington, in the last
English war. This gentleman is married to a lady
of the well known family of Willing. Edward Crathorne,
the youngest son, is a merchant of Philadelphia.
He is married and has children. The eldest
daughter, Sarah, married T. M’Kean Pettit, Esq., a
judge of the District Court, in Philadelphia, and is
dead, leaving issue. Elizabeth, the youngest, is the
wife of Com. George Campbell Reed, of the navy,
and has no issue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In considering the character of Dale, we are
struck with its simple modesty and frank sincerity,
quite as much as with its more brilliant qualities.
His courage and constancy were of the highest order,
rendering him always equal to the most critical duties,
and never wearying in their performance. Such
a man is perfectly free from all exaggeration. As he
was not afraid to act when his cooler judgment approved,
he had no distrusts to overcome ere he could
forbear, as prudence dictated. Jones found him a
man ready and willing to second all his boldest and
most hazardous attempts, so long as reason showed
the probabilities of success; but the deed done, none
more thoroughly stripped it of all false coloring, or
viewed it in a truer light than he who had risked his
life in aiding to achieve it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The person of Dale was in harmony with his moral
qualities. It was manly, seaman-like, and of singularly
respectable bearing. Simplicity, good faith,
truth and courage were imprinted on his countenance,
which all who were thrown into his company
soon discovered was no more than the mirror of his
mind. The navy has had more brilliant intellects,
officers of profounder mental attainments, and of
higher natural gifts, but it has had few leaders of
cooler judgment, sounder discretion, more inflexible
justice, or indomitable resolution. He was of a nature,
an experience, and a professional skill to command
respect and to inspire confidence, tributes that
were cheerfully paid by all who served under his
orders. The writer of this article has had extensive
opportunities of hearing character discussed among
the sea-officers of his country; few escape criticism,
of some sort or other, for their professional acts, and
fewer still, as men; yet he cannot recall a single instance
in which he has ever heard a whisper of complaint
against the public or private career of Richard
Dale. This total exemption from the usual fortunes
of the race may, in part, be owing to the shortness
of the latter’s service in the present marine, and to
the limited acquaintance of his cotemporaries, but
it is difficult to believe that it is not chiefly to
be ascribed to the thoroughly seaman-like character
of the officer, and to the perfect truth and sterling
probity of the man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This sword has, quite recently, become the subject of
public discussion, and of some private feeling, under circumstances
not wholly without interest to the navy and
the country. At page 63, vol. 2, of Mackenzie’s Life of Paul
Jones, is the following note, viz.:</p>

</td></tr>
</table>
</div>

<div class='blockquote0r8'>

<p class='pindent'>“This sword was sent by Jones’ heirs to his valued
friend, Robert Morris, to whose favor he had owed his
opportunities of distinguishing himself. Mr. Morris gave
the sword to the navy of the United States. It was to be
retained and worn by the senior officer, and transmitted
at his death, to his successor. After passing through the
hands of Commodore Barry, <span class='it'>and one or two other senior
officers</span>, it came into possession of Commodore Dale, and
now remains in his family, through some mistake in the
nature of the bequest, which seems to require that it should
either be restored to the navy in the person of its senior
officer, or else revert to the heirs of Mr. Robert Morris,
from one of whom the writer has received this information.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Captain Mackenzie has been correctly informed as to
a portion of the foregoing statement, is as probable as it is
certain he has been misled as to the remainder. It would
have been more discreet, however, in a writer to have heard
both sides, previously to laying such a statement before the
world. A very little inquiry might have satisfied him that
Commodore Dale could not have held any thing as the
senior officer of the navy, since he never occupied that
station. We believe the following will be found to be
accurate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the manner in which Commodore Barry became possessed
of this sword we know nothing beyond report, and
the statement of Captain Mackenzie. We understand that
a female member of the Morris family gives a version of
the affair like that published in the note we have quoted,
but the accuracy of her recollections can hardly be put in
opposition to the <span class='it'>acts</span> of such men as Barry and Dale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sword never passed through the hands “<span class='it'>of one or two
other senior officers</span>,” as stated by Captain Mackenzie, at all.
It was bequeathed by Commodore Barry to Commodore
Dale, in his will, and in the following words, viz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Item, I give and bequeath to my good friend Captain
Richard Dale, <span class='it'>my</span> gold-hilted sword, as a token of my
esteem for him.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have carefully examined the will, inventory, &amp;c. of
Commodore Barry. The first is dated February 27, 1803;
the will is proved and the inventory filed in the following
September, in which month Commodore Barry died. Now,
Commodore Dale was not in the navy at all, when this
sword was bequeathed to him, nor when he received it.
Dale resigned in the autumn of 1802; and he never rose
nearer to the head of the list of captains, than to be the
third in rank; Barry, himself, and Samuel Nicholson, being
his seniors, when he resigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The inventory of Commodore Barry’s personal property
is very minute, containing articles of a value as low as one
dollar. It mentions <span class='it'>two</span> swords, both of which are specifically
bequeathed—viz. “<span class='it'>my</span> gold-hilted” and “<span class='it'>my</span> silver-hilted
sword.” No allusion is made in the will to any
trust. Only these two swords were found among the assets,
and each was delivered agreeably to the bequest.
The gold-hilted sword was known in the family, as the
“Paul Jones sword,” and there is not the smallest doubt
Commodore Barry intended to bequeath this particular
sword, in full property, to Commodore Dale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us next look to the probabilities of the case. The heirs
of Paul Jones, who left no issue, gave the sword to Robert
Morris, says Captain Mackenzie, as a mark of gratitude.
This may very well be true. But Mr. Morris “gave the
sword to the navy of the United States,” to be retained and
worn by its senior officer. It would have been a more
usual course to have lodged the sword in the Navy Department,
had such been the intention. That Commodore Barry
did not view <span class='it'>his</span> possession of the sword in this light, is
clear enough by his will. He gave it, <span class='it'>without</span> restraint of
any sort, to a friend who was not in the navy at all, and
who never had been its senior officer. This he did, in full
possession of his mind and powers, six months before he
died, and under circumstances to render any misconception
highly improbable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can we find any motive for the bequest of Commodore
Barry? It was not personal to himself, as the sword went
out of his own family. The <span class='it'>other sword</span> he gave to a brother-in-law.
“Paul Jones’ sword” was bequeathed to a distinguished
professional friend—to one who, of all others, next
to Jones himself, had the best professional right to wear it—to
“Paul Jones’ first lieutenant.” Commodore Dale did
leave sons, and some in the navy; and the country will believe
that the one who now owns the sword has as good a
moral right to wear it, as the remote collaterals of Jones, and
a much better right than the senior officer of the navy, on
proof as vague as that offered. His <span class='it'>legal</span> right to the sword
seems to be beyond dispute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the inventory of Commodore Barry’s personals, this
sword is thus mentioned, viz.—“a very elegant gold-hilted
sword—$300.” The other sword is thus mentioned, viz.—“a
handsome silver-hilted, do. $100.”</p>

<div><h1><a id='wid'></a>THE WIDOW OF NEWBURY.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “HENRI QUATRE.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>’Twas the eve of Newbury fair, and the time
near the close of the long reign of Harry the Eighth,
after monasteries were suppressed. Reform stalked
through the land—all things were turned topsy-turvy—abbots
and monks beggared, that poor lords might
thrive—priests permitted marriage, and nuns driven
from their pleasant retreats, were forced to spin for
a livelihood. But amid the greater marvels, the
townspeople of Newbury had often leisure to ask
why Mistress Avery remained so long a widow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sitting in her embowered porch, watching the
cavalcade of merchants, buffoons and jugglers, on
their way to the encampment and site of the morrow’s
revels, she attracted many a longing eye. The
merchant, whose wandering vocation led him from
ancient Byzantium to the shores of the Thames, who
came to Newbury to exchange rich silks and foreign
jewelry for broadcloth, as he rode by the capacious
square tenement, with its deep, embayed windows
of dark chesnut-wood, and caught a glimpse of the
fair owner, sighed when contrasting his own desolate,
wandering lot with that of the fortunate wooer of the
rich, comely widow. Mistress Avery was relict of
the richest clothier of Newbury, who, dying, left her
in sole possession of looms, lands, tenements and
leases. Handsome, young, brisk, with riches unquestionable,
she attracted tender regards from all
quarters—even the proud gentry of Berkshire, with
genealogical tree rooting from Norman marauder,
far back as the conquest, disdained not an alliance
garnished with broad manors, woods of a century’s
growth, and goodly array of tenements, of which
our widow held fee-simple. But when pressed successively
by belted knight and worshipful esquire,
she courteously declined their offers, alleging she
was bent on marrying one of her own class in life,
(if she should change condition,) one who could take
upon himself, without degradation, the task of superintending
the looms. High born swains repulsed, the
field was open to gallants of lowlier rank. But these
faring no better, and incurring the ridicule of neighbors,
suitors became shy and reserved, seeking to
extract token of favor ere they avowed themselves.
If the curate called, ’twas merely an inquiry after
her soul’s health—the inquiry perhaps linked to a request
that she would, from her stores of boundless
wealth, add a trifle to the contributions of the poor’s
box. The lawyer had his ever ready and undeniable
excuses for visiting—leases there were to sign, indentures
to cancel. Nor was the tailor barred his
plea—was there not much broadcloth yearly fashioned
into apparel for lusty serving-man, active apprentice?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Behind Mistress Avery, as she sat gazing at the
straggling pageantry, there loitered in hall and doorway
the apprentices and domestic servants of the
household. Distinguished amongst his companions,
by superior stature, stood John Winehcomb, chief
apprentice. To him the widow oft turned with remark
on passing stranger; the soft regard thrown
into her address would have excused boldness in
one far less favored by nature than the apprentice,
but his answers were submissive, modest, even bashful.
An acute observer might perhaps have detected
a shade of discontent on the widow’s handsome features,
perhaps, as fancifully, attributed it to the coyness
and reserve of young Winehcomb; and, indeed,
as revolving months lengthened the period of widowhood,
there had not been wanting whispers, that
’Prentice John stood a fairer chance with his mistress
than all the knights or reputable burgher citizens
and yeomen of the county. His appearance certainly
did not gainsay the rumor—he had completed his
twentieth year, health flushed his cheeks, honesty
and intelligence stamped his looks—the features
were bold and decided, though of modest expression.
In character, he was one of those gifted youths, in
whom strict attention and unvarying promptitude
supply the place of experience, and who acquire the
management and conduct of business, in ordinary
cases, rarely entrusted to men of mature years. The
clothier, when dying, recommended his spouse to
confide business affairs to John—she had done so; in
the factory and with the workmen ’Prentice John
was all and everything—from his word ’twas useless
to appeal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But when young Winehcomb’s credit with Mistress
Avery was canvassed, the gossips were at a loss to
affix on decisive marks of favor or tenderness. ’Tis
true, he accompanied her to church, but so did the
other apprentices—walked by her side, sat next his
mistress during prayers, his arm was accepted, his
hand arranged the cushions—but then, was he not
chief apprentice, would it not be slighting to prefer
the services of a junior? Look narrowly at his
conduct—there were none of the characteristics of a
favored swain, no semblance of behavior indicating
one presumptuous of the honor, nor could the absence
of these tokens be attributed to natural timidity in
the presence of the sex, for at country meetings and
fairs, where hoydenish romping was the usual diversion
of youth, John participated in rustic gallantries.
Yet, sooth to say, though the gossips were at fault,
they were not wrong in their conjectures; the widow
was deeply in love with ’Prentice John, for his sake
had dismissed high-born suitors, wealthy citizens,
and, we need hardly say, (though scrupulously regardful
of reputation,) had given him many hints,
which, alas! he was slow to understand. It might
be inexperience, want of self-confidence, or innate
modesty, which withheld the youth from tracing her
encouragement to its real motive; but from whatever
cause, Mistress Avery, who had a very high opinion
of her own personal attractions, knew he must be
perfectly well acquainted with her riches, was greatly
perplexed with his diffidence, his want of susceptibility,
and concluded the apprentice must be in love
elsewhere to withstand such allurements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One while, racked with jealousy, determined in
very spite and vexation to accept the offer of the first
suitor, the next hour affection gained the ascendancy,
and she resolved to declare her love. But pride took
fire and caused a tumult in the heart, of which young
Winehcomb, the unconscious origin, was little aware.
How provoking the calmness of his replies, the quiet
gaze which met her impassioned glance! Oft with
difficulty she refrained from bestowing a hearty cuff
on the cold youth, object of fond desire—as often,
and with greater difficulty, did she refrain from tenderer
salute. To-morrow shall put this wilful-headed
boy to the test! If his heart be engaged, it
is more than likely he has made an assignation,
which I will frustrate! So thought Mistress Avery,
revolving a scheme to bring young Diffidence on his
knees, or to a direct confession that he loved another.
Under pretence of making inquiries respecting the
description of merchandise then passing the house,
borne on a long train of pack-horses, under conduct
of merchants of foreign aspect, the widow beckoned
the apprentice (who was standing at respectful distance,
beneath the threshold, with his fellow apprentices)
to approach her chair, placed outside the house
under cover of the overarching porch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“John!” said the dame, fixing her large eyes on
the youth, “I warrant there is store enough of trinkets
and finery in yon bales to satisfy the wants of
every maiden in Newbury. Happy the youth whose
wages are unspent, for to-morrow, by ’r Lady! he
might buy the love of the most hard-hearted damsel.
Certes, no swain need die of love, if he have money
in his purse!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If the love were bought by those foreign pedlar
wares, it would not be much for a Newbury lad to
boast of,” replied the young man, blushing—for the
gaze of his mistress was keen and ardent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Are the lads of Newbury then so disinterested,
Master John,” exclaimed the widow. “Well! I
will put one, at least, to the proof. I must walk
through the fair, if only to chat with my tenants’
wives from Spene and Thatcham, and shall need
your protection, for these strange foreigners may be
rude, and Cicely is such a coward she would run
away.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Avery was rather baffled by the result of her
own feint; for, contrary to expectation, she could
discover neither chagrin nor disappointment; the
apprentice answered cheerfully, he should be proud
to attend on his honored mistress, and would not forget
a good cudgel, more than a match for any
foreigner’s steel—nay, to ensure her from insult, he
would bring all his fellow apprentices. This was
more than the lady desired. She was again puzzled,
and declined, rather pettishly, the extra corps of
gallants, volunteered by the apprentice, more especially,
as she affirmed that it was contrary to the letter
and spirit of their indentures, which guaranteed
festival and fair-days to be at their own disposal.
But they would gladly abandon the privilege to do
her service, rejoined the pertinacious and simple
youth, with ill-timed assiduity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Fool!” muttered the widow between her teeth,
but not so indistinctly as to pass unheard by the
apprentice, who immediately drew back abashed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A bright morrow gladdened the hearts of the good
folk of Newbury. The morn was occupied in the
sale and purchase of commodities—the staple article
of the town was readily exchanged for foreign merchandise,
or broad Spanish pieces, as suited the inclination
of the parties dealing. These were busy
hours for young Winehcomb and his associates, but
amply redeemed by the gayety and attractive dissipation
of the afternoon. In walking through the fair,
Mistress Avery leaned on the youth’s arm, an honor
envied the apprentice by many an anxious, would-be
suitor. Ere growing tired of the drollery of the jugglers,
mountebanks and buffoons, or the more serious
spectacle of the scenic moralites, they encountered
Master Luke Milner, the attorney, who thought the
opportunity should not be thrown away of endeavoring
to gain the widow’s good graces. Master Luke
believed his chance very fair—he was of good family,
on the youthful side of thirty, but exceedingly foppish,
after the style of the London gallants, but caricatured—too
many ribbons on doublet, too many
jewels on beaver, shoes garnished with roses large
as sunflowers. “The worshipful attorney will never
do for me,” thought Mistress Avery! She had often
thought so, and was blind to many courtesies and
compliments which the learned man ventured to
throw in with his legal opinions. But now she had
a part to play, a stratagem to practice on the feelings
of young Winehcomb. Love, like hunger, will
break through every restraint; she scrupled not
making the lawyer’s vanity subservient to her policy,
and, accordingly, listened to his flattery with more
than ordinary attention, keeping an eye, the while,
on ’Prentice John, to observe the effect of the
legal gallant’s honeyed speeches. Alas! for poor,
love-stricken Mistress Avery—no burning jealousy
flushed the cheek of John—lightened in his eye, or
trembled through his frame! Hearing the conversation
grow each moment more interesting and tender,
believing himself one too many, he politely retired to
a respectful distance. Was he so cold and insensible,
the handsome blockhead? soliloquized Mistress
Avery, heedless of the lawyer’s flowing speeches—I
will break the indentures—banish him the house!
The wretch!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not cold, not insensible, Mistress Avery, for see!
Even whilst he loiters, there approaches a party from
the village of Spene, with whom our apprentice is
intimate—he laughs, chats with the young men and
maidens, and finally, as the mirth grows more uproarious,
salutes a very handsome, fresh colored,
smart young damsel. The dame, who witnessed the
scene, stung with jealousy, believing her suspicions
confirmed, broke off abruptly, whilst Master Luke
was at the very <span class='it'>acme</span> of his tender theme; leaving
the astonished gallant, cap in hand, to the derision of
acquaintance, who sarcastically advised him to repair
the loss by writ of error.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>Though the widow took no notice of the incident
which aroused her jealousy, John was made sensible
he had incurred her displeasure. She walked silent,
moody, reserved, scarcely replied to his remarks;
her large, dark eye flashed anger, but the apprentice,
though awed, was struck with its beauty, more struck
than he had ever been. It was a new sensation he
experienced. He inwardly deprecated the threatened
wrath, wondered by what sad mischance he had incurred
it, was more tremblingly alive to her resentment,
than when oft-times—during the course of apprenticeship—conscious
of deserving it. A strange,
uneasy feeling began to haunt him—he was sensible
of loss of favor, and though, after taxing memory,
unconscious of merited disgrace—was surprised, inquieted,
by the deep dejection of spirits under which
he labored. It seemed as though he had incurred a
loss, of which he knew not the extent till now. His
arm trembled, and she snappishly rebuked his unsteadiness;
he again encountered her glance—it was
wild, angry, fierce, yet he felt he could have looked
forever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They were opposite one of those temporary taverns,
erected for the accommodation of the higher classes
frequenting the fair—tricked out with gaudy splendor,
yet affording delicious viands, choice wines to wearied
strollers. It so happened that, passing by the
open doorway, their progress was arrested by Master
Nathaniel Buttress, the wealthy tanner—mean,
avaricious, advanced in years, yet ardently longing
to add the widow’s possessions to his own accumulated
riches. With studied bow, and precise flourish
of beaver, he bade Mistress Avery good day, and followed
up the salute by invitation to sip a glass of
sack, the fashionable beverage of the time. At fair-season,
there was not the slightest impropriety, either
in the offer, or its acceptation—it was quite in the
usual license of these festivals. But ’Prentice John
was doubly surprised; in the first place, that the
miserly tanner (his niggardliness was proverbial)
should have screwed up courage to treat any one with
the high-priced nectar—and that his arm, which he
gallantly offered, should have been accepted with
alacrity by the fair dame, who, our apprentice was
aware, had oft made devious circuits, on many
occasions, to elude a meeting. Young Winehcomb
found himself, lacquey-fashion, following in the rear.
He was deeply mortified—such circumstance had
never happened before—yet, though vexed, the annoyance
was only secondary to extreme surprise at
the character of his own feelings. He had valued
highly the good will, kind words, and occasional
gifts of the lady, as proofs of favor, founded on his
honesty, diligence and promptitude, or, at least, without
deeply analizing his feelings, believed that in
such spirit he received them. But now, smarting
under disgrace, it seemed as though lost favor was
dear for its own sake—bereft of smiles to which he
had been insensible till the present hour, he was unhappy,
miserable. ’Prentice John had great difficulty
in withholding his cudgel from the tanner’s back, but
though he gave him not a beating, he mentally promised
one. Master Buttress, elated with good fortune,
was more vain-glorious than cautious; unlike
prudent lover, uncertain of continuance of sudden
favor, dreading loss of vantage ground, snatched by
eager rivals, he escorted the dame to a conspicuous
seat, whence they could behold the fair, from whence
his favored lot was visible to all. The ready drawers,
ere ardor called, hastened to place before the guests
a tray laden with costly delicacies, crowned with
silver flagon full of the favorite potation. Young
Winehcomb, who sat apart, though partaking the
dainties, was maddened to behold his mistress listen
so complacently to the addresses of the veteran
suitor. Could she be serious? And if she were—what
then? Was she not absolute mistress of herself,
her wealth—and was he so specially concerned
in her choice? This self-questioning elicited the
conviction, startling though true, that he was deeply,
personally concerned. He was, then, undeniably in
love with his mistress! Was the passion of sudden
growth, the birth of the present hour? Alas! no—it
had been long smouldering unconsciously—nay, if
he doubted, memory flashed innumerable, though till
now, unnoticed facts proving its existence—and he
had foolishly let slip the golden chance of wooing
till too late—till his advantages were the prey of a
successful rival!—his own affection only brought to
light by the torch of jealousy. Such was the cruel,
torturing position of young Winehcomb. ’Twas
aggravated in being obliged to listen to the tanner’s
flattery, to witness its favorable reception. Nay,
worse—he became conscious that Mistress Avery
remarked his inquietude, his ill-suppressed hatred of
Master Nathaniel, as her eye was often for a moment
bent on him. He was convinced she took pleasure
in his torments, for on these occasions her manner—though
strictly within the rigid limits of propriety—invariably
was more marked and tender toward
the detested, fulsome niggard. He had heard, alas!
such was the custom of the sex. Often was ’Prentice
John resolved on leaving the lovers to their own
conversation, but restrained anger on reflecting it
was his duty to be present with and protect Mistress
Avery, till she quitted the fair and returned home.
Nor did he relish the notion of leaving the field altogether
to the tanner—jealousy united with sense of
duty in detaining the youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Buttress was in rare good humor; he could
not deem otherwise but that he was the fortunate,
chosen man, and he found leisure in the intervals of fits
of gallantry, to conjure flitting visions of broad manor
added to broad manor, tenement to tenement, and to
picture the future Master—nay, Worshipful Master
Nathaniel Buttress, richest gentleman in the county
of Berkshire. The only damp on his high spirits was
the present outlay; he had been drawn into expenses
far beyond usual habits; had never been guilty of
similar extravagance; the veriest prodigal of London
could not have ordered a more costly board; and
that tall, rosy-cheeked lad imbibed the precious sack
with the avidity of a sponge, and never looked a
tithe the better humored, but sat grinning menaces at
him—the donor of the feast! Well! well! all should
soon be remedied, and the disagreeable, lanky apprentice
turned adrift.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But who is that now passing the tavern; is it not
Master Luke Milner, the attorney? How enviously
he looks! he has the reputation of having pressed
hard his own suit, but in vain! If I invite him, he
will gladly come—drink the widow’s health—and it
will save me half the reckoning!” So reasoned the
tanner. The lawyer accepted the invitation, though
a slight shade of displeasure, he could not wholly
dispel, flushed his brow. Master Luke entered,
bowing lowly to the widow. Drawing a chair, near
as good manners admitted, to the fair dame, he carefully
deposited scented gloves and jeweled beaver
on adjoining bench, and, in sitting, showed anxiety
to display a trim foot, though rather overshadowed
by the large roses. The tanner soon perceived that
avarice had induced a grievous oversight, for the
widow was not quite won. It was both unaccountable
and annoying—how perverse these women are!
she seemed now disposed to extend as much favor to
Master Luke as she had previously exhibited to Master
Buttress. ’Prentice John was pleased and distressed
at the scene—glad of the tanner’s discomfiture,
he was enraged at the other’s success. The
elder suitor had shown indifference to the presence
of the apprentice, viewed him as a necessary appendage
to the widow’s state, or, at worst, a tax on his
purse to the extent of sack imbibed; but our lawyer,
nearer John’s own age, and gifted with keener eye
than his rival, liked not young Winehcomb’s vicinity,
his prying, resolute gaze.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mistress Avery,” said the lawyer blandly, “our
young friend appears uneasy; nor do I wonder, for
more than once, in the fair, did I hear red, pouting
lips lament the absence of Jack Winehcomb. I pray
thee, suffer the lad to stroll where he lists; Master
Nathaniel and your unworthy servant, with permission,
will zealously protect the pride and boast of
Newbury.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If John had broken any engagement by attendance
on her, replied the dame—and a keen smile, part
malicious, part searching, lit up the widow’s features
as she gazed on the disconcerted youth—let him seek
Cicely, who was not far off, to take his place, and he
had full permission to absent himself. ’Prentice
John, though vexed and out of countenance, said he
had no other engagement than duty enjoined, and he
was entirely at his mistress’ command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Then I must not spoil Cicely’s holiday,” remarked
the widow. The apprentice was doubtful
whether she spoke in displeasure or not—the tone of
voice and expression of countenance were equivocal.
A quiet smile, which played for an instant around
her mouth, when he declared he had no engagement,
presaged returning favor, but the horizon was again
clouded. Mistress Avery, turning to the gallants,
said the youth should have his own way, that for herself
she never found his presence irksome—he was
so stupid, she might talk treason in his company
without danger—what she was obliged to say was
generally misunderstood. Stupid! misunderstood!
Were there, in these words, more meant than met the
ear? Had he been so blind, so deaf? Meanwhile
the situation of the rivals was far from pleasant; the
tanner had introduced an enemy within the fortress,
whom he could neither dislodge nor compete with;
the lawyer was angry that he had not the field to
himself; whilst fair Mistress Avery, with impartial
justice, hung the scales of favor suspended. Neither
could now positively declare he was the chosen
swain. Half suppressed taunts, and sarcasm clothed
in ceremonious language, threatened more open
bickering, when Master Luke, with due regard to a
lady’s feelings, besought her to pardon their absence
for a few minutes, as he suddenly recollected an affair
important to the welfare of his friend, Master Buttress.
The dame was condescending, declared she
had too much regard for Master Nathaniel to deem
their absence a slight, under the circumstances; so
the lawyer, affecting to produce a leathern note-case,
retired with his rival. The apprentice felt his situation
awkward, but he was presently relieved; Mistress
Avery bade him follow the gentlemen unperceived,
and if they drew weapons, or otherwise exhibited
hostilities, immediately interfere to prevent
mischief. Concealed by the angle of a canvass booth,
he listened, unseen, to the wordy strife. The lawyer
was cool, sarcastic, overbearing; the tanner, fiery
and threatening. Presuming on youth, good figure,
and flowing rhetoric, the former contemned the pretensions
of the elder rival, whom he affirmed had
nothing to recommend him but wealth not needed;
why, therefore, pursue a rivalry, when he could not
lay claim to one certain token of affection? And the
man of law began enumerating the distinguishing
marks of favor which Dame Avery, spite of prudent,
cautious, self-restraint, could not avoid exhibiting as
soon as he entered the tavern. The tanner’s replication
was in the same style. If these be marks of
affection, thought the listener, what would they say
to my pretensions if I told all? And ’Prentice John,
as he listened and commented on what he heard,
grew a wiser, more knowing youth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If thou wert a younger man, Master Nathaniel,”
said the lawyer, “there would be no need for these
mutual taunts. We have a readier mode of settling⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Curse thy youth, and thee too,” exclaimed the
tanner; “ ’cause thou art a vain, braggart fop, with
thy galloon and thy large cabbage roses, think’st
to brave it over me?—there!—and there!” And so
saying, the valiant tanner dealt successive cuffs on
Master Luke’s doublet, and drawing weapon, awaited
the attack. Their rapiers—for the tanner, though
following a handicraft, yet, as owning broad lands,
deemed himself entitled to wear a weapon and
dub himself gentleman—immediately crossed, but
the alert apprentice, with stout cudgel, threw himself
between and struck down their guard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good sirs! good sirs! forbear!” cried one hastening
to assist young Winehcomb. ’Twas the curate
of Spene. The belligerents immediately sheathed
their weapons, muttering future vengeance. The
holy man requested to know the cause of quarrel,
and offered to act as umpire. This, after demur and
consideration, was agreed to. Hearing each in turn,
he proposed, as more becoming their respective
characters than fighting, that the case should be stated
to Mistress Avery—the election left to the fair widow.
As each deemed himself the favored candidate, and,
indeed, with good cause, for our dame had been
gracious to both, the curate’s proposal was accepted,
and his eloquence solicited to open the pleadings.
The party thereupon returned to the tavern, the apprentice
not the least interested actor in the drama.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The curate of Spene, though grave and sententious,
threw into his speech an under current of humor and
<span class='it'>bonhommie</span>, which touched off the pretensions of each
suitor with dramatic effect and felicity. Neither
could question his impartiality, nor had he, as he
affirmed, secret preponderance either way; both
were esteemed friends, both had received the offices
of the church at his hands, both had listened to his
Sabbath exhortations. Which of the twain reigned
in the lady’s heart, to him he should offer congratulation;
to the other he could fairly say, that he merited
the honor for which he had unsuccessfully striven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause, a deep silence. The blushing
widow must now speak, declare herself, decide her
own fate, and with it the fortunes of the suitors. How
ardently did ’Prentice John long for one of the many
opportunities of pleading his passion, oft thrown in
his way, so heedlessly neglected! Would she indeed
make an election? then, farewell, Newbury! in some
far distant land would he hide his disgrace, forget
his folly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mistress Avery said the gentlemen had certainly
given her cause long to remember Newbury Fair;
yet they could not expect her mind made up on so
momentous a question of a sudden; besides, it was
now Wednesday, which had ever been an unlucky
day with the Averys, but to-morrow (Thursday) week
they should have a decisive answer—her preference
made known—provided, and it was the only stipulation
besides secrecy, they both refrained pressing
their amorous suits in the interim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So ended the conference, and as the rivals, with
the curate, gallantly bade the lady adieu (having promised
obedience in every particular) ’Prentice John,
in a paroxysm of anger and remorse, made firm resolve
that he would challenge to mortal combat the
favored suitor, beat him within an inch of life if he
refused to fight, upbraid the widow for secretly fomenting
a passion which she laughed at, and flee,
forever, the town of Newbury.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You forget, John, I shall need your arm through
the press,” exclaimed the dame reproachfully. The
apprentice started; he had been leaning against the
bench, lost in bitter reverie; he saw not his mistress
was waiting. Uttering an indistinct apology, he escorted
the lady from the tavern in time to witness that
the tanner had been sufficiently adroit to palm off
half the expense of the entertainment on his rival.
Whether this was omen of higher fortune, the sequel
will show.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They scarcely spoke during the remainder of the
walk, nor even after reaching home. ’Prentice John
was reserved, melancholy, brooding over bitter reflections;
the dame, sly, observant, oft casting furtive
glances at young Winehcomb, seemingly, as he
thought, indulging secret pleasure on beholding his
misery. On the morrow they were together in the
compting-room; it was his duty to produce entries
of the bales of cloth sold during the business-period
of the Fair; to account for the same in bullion, or
according to the terms of sale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“These for thyself, John,” said the widow, placing
a few gold pieces on the table, whilst she proceeded
to place, under triple lock, the remainder. They remained
untouched. The third lock of the huge iron
chest duly shot, the dame arose, was surprised on
beholding the money still lying unappropriated; John
looking like man under sentence of death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have I grown niggardly, Master Winehcomb?”
exclaimed the widow, “speak, if you would have
more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>John replied by asking if she thought the ten pieces
sufficient to equip him, and pay passage to Cadiz,
where he heard an expedition was fitting out, in which
many Englishmen had volunteered. Mistress Avery,
with a calmness which confirmed his despair, replied
in the negative, but demanded why he should think
of starting for Cadiz, ere, indeed, his indentures were
determined. The apprentice declared wildly, if she
married either tanner or lawyer, he would depart,
even with no more than the ten pieces, and for his
reasons—he was not then sufficiently master of himself
to detail them!</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, John,” said the widow, in a tone of expostulation,
whilst a smile lurked in the eyes and round
the mouth, “what am I to do if I say No? they press
me so hard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Newbury apprentice, at his mistress’ feet,
taught the answer she should give. On the following
Monday, Master John Winehcomb was united in
marriage with Mistress Avery—the wedding celebrated
by the grandest entertainment ever beheld in
the county of Berkshire, the fame whereof spread
even as far as the court of bluff Harry. If lacking
splendor in any particular, the omission was owing
to the short time for preparation, as no expense was
spared. The unfortunate suitors, of course, understood
the affair from common report, and thought it
unnecessary to seek their fate at the widow’s domicil,
when they could learn it from every man,
woman and child in the town. They were invited
to the wedding feast, but wisely declined, as the story
of their strange wooing was already abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was the custom, in those days, for the bridegroom
to salute the bride on the cheek, in the church,
after the ceremony was performed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And you are ready to swear, Master John,”
whispered the dame as the bridegroom approached,
“that you never saw that damsel before Fair-day,
whom you kissed at the Fair?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No—nor since!” replied he, believing it a hint
for his future conduct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Master Winehcomb lived happily—his wealth increased
so quickly, with the increasing demand for
the staple article of Newbury, that when the Earl of
Surrey marched against James the Fourth of Scotland,
who was then ravaging the borders, the rich
clothier accompanied the expedition with a retinue
of one hundred servants and artisans, clothed and
armed at his own expense. The memory of John
Winehcomb and his rich and handsome spouse was
long preserved in their native town.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had penetrated to the depth of the pine grove,
and it was difficult to find our way out through the
tangled undergrowth and the unequal hollows; but
Malina had become thoughtful for others once more,
and though excitement no longer made her own progress
easy, she guarded me with double care; lifted
me over the hollows and carried me in her arms
when the thickets were too intricate or the ground
very uneven. She kissed me as we reached a foot-path
which led to our cottage, and, pointing to the
door, would have left me to go home alone; but when
she saw that I was troubled regarding my torn frock,
kindness of heart prompted her to come back. She
led me to the house, explained my misfortune, and
went away. I sat down on the door-sill and watched
her till she entered the portico of her mother’s dwelling,
and when they remarked on her dejected looks,
and questioned me of the cause, I answered that Malina
was tired with walking so long in the woods,
for it seemed as if the tears which I had seen her
shed and the passionate words which she had uttered
were a secret which I should do wrong to mention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In about an hour Phebe Gray and our young minister
stopped at the door-yard gate to inquire for Malina.
I told them that she had gone home, and when
Mr. Mosier lifted me in his arms, and, looking into
my face, asked what I had been crying about, I
turned my head away to evade his kiss and besought
him to set me down. The contrast between his
happy face, the deep and almost brilliant expression
of joy which lighted it up, and the sorrowful look of
poor Malina forced itself even on my childish mind.
I felt that which I had no power to comprehend, and
from that time never loved our minister nor Phebe
Gray as I had loved them. They walked home very
slowly, she leaning on his arm with an air of dependence
and trustfulness which was full of feeling
and feminine delicacy; he would check their progress
every few moments to point out some familiar
beauty in the landscape, as if they had never looked
upon it before. They loitered by the rock spring,
and along the river road, tranquil in their happiness,
till the dusk almost concealed them as they entered
Mrs. Gray’s house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Almost every evening, for a week, our minister
and Phebe Gray took their walk around the pine
grove, and always alone. Malina was confined to
the house. She had taken cold, Mrs. Gray said, and
the night air was bad for her lungs. But often, when
her sister was loitering along the river’s bank, happy
in the wealth of her newly aroused affections, Malina
might be seen at her chamber window, with her
cheek languidly supported by a hand which was becoming
thinner each day, and gazing earnestly after
the two beings dearest to her on earth, but whose
happiness she could not witness without emotions
that were well nigh killing her. Her mother saw
nothing of this. She only knew that Malina was
quieter than usual and not very well, that her eyes
were heavy and her step languid as she moved around
the house. She did not see the heart struggling
against itself, the stern principle which grew strong
in the contest. She never dreamed of that desolate
and lonely sensation which haunted her daughter’s
pillow with watchfulness, and made her waking
hours a season of trial cruel as the grave. She saw
that Malina was strangely affected; true, she smiled
still, but it was meekly, sadly, and it seemed as if
the music of her laugh was exhausted forever; her
eyes grew misty and sorrowful in their expression,
and tears would sometimes fill them without apparent
cause. Still it was gravely asserted that Malina
had only a slight cold, a nervous attack which would
go off in a day or two! But there was something in
her illness which Phebe could not comprehend; a
wish for solitude, and a strange nervous dread of
any thing like intimate conversation with herself,
which prevented an acknowledgment of her own
deep causes of happiness. Her sensitive modesty
made her desirous of some encouragement to unburden
her heart of its wealth of hope even to her
sister, and when she saw that Malina shunned her,
that her eyes had a wandering and estranged look
whenever they turned upon her face, she felt checked
and almost repulsed in her confidence. If any thing
could have disturbed the pure happiness which
reigned in her bosom, it would have been this extraordinary
mood in one who had from childhood shared
every thought and wish almost as soon as it was
formed. It had a power to disturb, though it could
not entirely destroy the tranquillity of her mind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will talk with her about it to-night,” murmured
Phebe, as she opened her chamber door one evening,
after a long conversation with Mr. Mosier in the
portico. “I wish, though, she would ask some question,
or even look curious to know what keeps us
together so much; I little thought to have kept a
secret from Malina so long.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As these thoughts passed through her mind, Phebe
Gray gathered up the bed-drapery, and lying down
by her sister, passing an arm caressingly over her
waist, laid her blushing cheek against the now pallid
face which rested on the pillow. She felt that tears
were upon it, and that the snowy linen under her
head was wet as if Malina had cried herself to sleep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Malina, wake up a minute, I have something to
tell you,” murmured the young girl, in a low, half
timid whisper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The moonbeams lay full upon the bed, and Phebe
Gray was looking earnestly in the face of the beautiful
sleeper. She could see the silken lashes quivering
on her cheek, and a tremulous motion of the lips,
nay, it seemed to her as if a single tear broke through
the lashes and rolled over the pale cheek, and she
was certain that something like a faint shudder crept
through the form which was half circled by her arm.
But Malina gave no answer, and the gentle questioner
was too sensitive for another effort to win attention.
She quietly laid her head on the pillow and sunk to
sleep, but not to indulge in the sweet, unbroken dream
of happiness which had shed roses over her couch so
many nights. There was sadness at heart, a presentiment
of coming ill, and a solicitude regarding
her sister which kept her anxious and rendered her
slumber broken and unrefreshing. About midnight,
when the stillness of her chamber rendered every
sound more than usually audible, she was disturbed
by the broken and half stifled sobs which arose from
her sister’s pillow. Again she stole her arm over
the weeping girl, and questioned her regarding the
source of her grief. Malina only turned her face
away, and sobbed more bitterly than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why will you not speak to me, Malina? what
has come between us of late?—speak to me, sister—you
are in sorrow, and I have—oh how much—cause
for joy! yet we have all at once learned to conceal
thoughts from one another. Tell me what troubles
you—for I cannot be entirely happy while you are ill
and so sad.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina redoubled her sobs, but amid the tumult of
her grief she murmured, “Tell me all, Phebe, all you
feel, all you wish; but I have no secrets, no sorrow.
There is a little pain in my side, sometimes, and that
makes me low spirited. I have always been so
healthy, you know, that a little illness frightens me.
Do not mind me, but talk of yourself. You are happy,
Phebe, <span class='it'>very</span> happy! were not those your words?
tell me all—I can be glad and rejoice in any thing
that gives you pleasure—any thing on earth—if my
heart were breaking. So let us talk it all over now,
the room is so quiet and dark, and we shall neither
of us get sleepy—do you think we shall, sister?—you
may, but I have almost forgotten how to sleep,” and,
as Malina ceased speaking, she stole an arm around
her sister’s neck, and, choking back her sobs, composed
herself to listen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe rose up in the bed, gathered the drapery
around them, for the moonbeams were bright enough
to reveal her blushes, and, sinking to her pillow,
again murmured the story of her love, its return, and
all the bright anticipations that made her future so
beautiful. Malina nerved herself to listen; she uttered
no word of distrust, and checked all manifestations
of discontent by a strong effort of self-control,
when all was told—when she was made certain that
her sister and the only being she had ever regarded
with more than a sister’s love, were to be married—that
their wedding day was fixed, and, that the mother’s
sanction had already been granted—she remained
silent for a moment, and strove to gain the
mastery over her feelings. When she spoke, her
frame shook with the bitter emotions which could
not be altogether subdued, but her voice was low
and very calm. Mr. Mosier was poor, and Phebe
not yet of age. If he were installed in the old meeting-house,
they would be compelled to live with Mrs.
Gray till something could be saved from his small
salary to purchase a dwelling and begin housekeeping.
This thought caused some anxiety to the engaged
couple. The young clergyman had learned something
of Mrs. Gray’s real character, and was reluctant
to erect his domestic altar beneath her tyrannical
auspices. Phebe, too, longed for a quiet home
of her own, a happy, free home, where she might
follow her own innocent impulses, unchecked and
without fear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall have that home, my sister,” said Malina
Gray, twining her arms around her companion,
and kissing her with a gush of true affection; “there
is the old parsonage house; you shall have that, and
the money which dear minister Brown left to me;
all are yours and <span class='it'>his</span>. You will be happy there—very
happy. I know he loved the old place. Now,
good night, Phebe; let us go to sleep!” and with a
low gasping sob, which was not the less painful that
it gave no sound, Malina turned away her head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe was too disinterested and high-minded herself,
for a thought of refusing Malina’s generosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We shall, indeed, be happy,” she said; “you
will come and live with us, and by the time you are
married, we shall have saved enough to pay all the
money back again. You <span class='it'>will</span> live with us?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina thought of the quiet grave-yard, which
could be seen from the parsonage window, and answered—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shall want no other home.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe talked on, more cheerfully than usual, and
when her sister did not answer, she thought her
asleep; but Malina had fainted, and lay senseless
upon her pillow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was soon rumored through the village that our
new minister was engaged to Phebe Gray, and every
body was delighted with the match. Phebe was just
the creature for a clergyman’s wife, quiet and gentle,
with manners that gave dignity to the softness of her
disposition. In the general satisfaction which reigned
in the village, Malina was quite overlooked. Her
change of appearance was imputed to sadness at
parting with her sister; and, at times, when the wedding
was talked of in her presence, the rich color
which burned over her cheeks, the brilliancy of her
eyes, and the flashes of wild merriment that sprung
to her lips, deceived the unobserving into a belief of
her entire happiness. She spent much of her time at
the old parsonage, superintending the arrangements
of her sister’s home with a degree of taste and energy
which surprised all who witnessed her exertions.
The rooms were all newly arranged, delicate paper
was purchased at New Haven for the walls, new
stepping stones were laid at the front door, green
blinds gave a look of elegance and seclusion to the
windows; the profuse rose bushes and lilac trees
were pruned, and a white picket-fence hedged in
the little wilderness of flowers which blossomed in
the front yard. The cabinet maker, on School
Hill, was busy with the furniture, all of a superior
kind. The carpet-weaver had borrowed two <span class='it'>quill-wheels</span>,
and all the spools, for a mile round, in order
to expedite the progress of sixty yards of striped carpeting
through his cumbrous loom. The house and
its adornments were to be comfortable and elegant
beyond any thing that had been known in our village
for a long time; and all was Malina’s work. Her
untiring assiduity created the little paradise which
another was to enjoy. Her money purchased the
books which filled the little study, whose window
opened upon the most verdant corner of the orchard.
Her trembling hands placed a new inlaid flute on the
little table, and drew the easy chair close by, that the
bridegroom might find every thing ready and home-like
in his new dwelling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One afternoon Malina was left alone; the workmen
had departed to their suppers, and her task was
finished for the day. She had just hung the pet robin
in his old place by the dining-room window; he
seemed to recognize the room, and flew about his
cage, chirping and fluttering his wings, as if to thank
her for bringing him home once more. It was the
first hour of repose that Malina had known for many
weeks, and now, that she had nothing more to perform,
painful thoughts and regrets that would no
longer be stifled, fell back upon her heart, and she
was, oh, how desolate! There, in her blooming
youth, she sat hopeless and weary of life—for what
is life to a woman without affection? The heart
was full of warm and generous feelings, burthened
with a wealth of tenderness, and yet she had no
future, nothing to hope for, nothing to dread; her
destiny seemed consummated there and then. Youth
is in itself so hopeful, that we can scarcely imagine
a creature in the first bud of life yearning for the
grave. But Malina was very sad. She looked through
the open door into the orchard; the green old apple
trees were heavy with blossoms, and through the
garniture of thrifty leaves, and the rosy shower which
blushed among them, a corner of the old meeting-house
met her gaze—a portion of the grave-yard, and
a new tomb-stone, which gleamed out from the young
grass which had already started up from our minister’s
death place. How green and quiet it looked—and
oh, how earnestly Malina Gray longed to lie
down in that still spot, and be at rest. Yet Malina
was young, and no human being dreamed how
wretched she was. The orchard was full of singing
birds that day, and there had been a time when the
gush of sweet sounds, that rose and swelled amid the
foliage, would have made her heart leap, but now it
filled her eyes with tears. The sunshine that played
and quivered among the leaves—the wind that now
and then gushed through the heavy boughs, scattering
the grass with rosy flakes, and sighing as it swept
off to the open plain—all seemed a mockery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was heart sick, and yearned to die. How
cruel is that power by which a broken heart draws
thoughts of sadness from the sweet and beautiful
things of nature. Malina gazed through her tears at
the change her own hands had wrought. The unseemly
plantains had disappeared from the back
door-step, and around the well-curb a bed of valley-lilies
were just forming their pearly buds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They will be in blossom for Phebe’s hair,” murmured
the young girl, “and for mine—for am I not to
be bridemaid?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With a mournful smile gleaming through her tears,
Malina arose, and tying on her bonnet, left the house.
She met Phebe and Mr. Mosier near the front gate.
They were sauntering toward their new dwelling,
tranquil and happy; to them, every thing whispered
of joy; the fragrant orchard, the birds caroling within
its shadows, and all the beautiful landscape were full
of pleasant associations. Every hope and thought in
<span class='it'>their</span> bosoms blossomed in unison with nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How true it is that thought and feeling, like the
sun, give color to outward things. The heart creates
its own sunshine, or the cloud through which nature
is revealed to it. Phebe Gray and her betrothed
husband felt nothing but the sweet and the beautiful—their
hearts were brimful of sunshine. But, alas,
for Malina, she looked through the cloud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina walked on. The two contented beings by
the gate were happy enough without her. She strove
to smile cheerfully as they spoke to her, and in a tone
of forced playfulness forbade them entering the house
till their wedding day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina had gathered beneath the roof of that old
parsonage house many luxuries almost unknown in
the neighborhood; every thing calculated to gratify
the fine taste of the young divine, or add to the comfort
of her sister, had been unsparingly purchased,
till her patrimony was almost exhausted. While
this duty lasted, and the excitement of action was
upon her, Malina sustained the burthen of her sorrows
with an aching, but firm heart. She had taken
no time for thought—scarcely for tears—but worked
on, as if toiling through a feverish dream. Her
cheeks were always flushed, and sometimes the
music of her laugh rang loud and strangely through
the bridal chamber which she was decorating; but
the companions who assisted her were often startled
by the reckless tone of her laugh; it was too absent
and wild for happiness or merriment, entirely deficient
in that low, rich melody, which had once
made her voice so full of healthy joy. Yet all the
neighbors were commenting on her generous conduct,
and the brilliancy of her spirits; and it was
often remarked that Malina Gray was never so fond
of company, so careless in her mirth, or so startling
in her wit, as she had been since the engagement of
her sister, and since she had recovered from the
slight cold which confined her to the house when
that engagement was first whispered in the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To a heart capable of self-sacrifice, there is no
feeling so lonely as that which follows exhausted
power. No conviction, so keenly painful, as a
knowledge that a beloved being, who has cost us
the hopes of a life in resigning, can be happy without
our aid—that we have nothing to render up—no
aim for exertion—nothing to do but sit down and
gaze upon the blank which existence has become.
Her task was done. The excitement over, and then
came to the heart of Malina Gray the toil and pain
of concealed suffering; the aching restlessness which
eats into the bud of human life. Once more it was
rumored that she was ill, and, but for other and more
absorbing subjects, Mrs. Gray might have been
alarmed for the safety of her child; but she was so
intent on other things, that the poor girl and her sufferings
remained unheeded at home, save by the
gentle Phebe and her betrothed husband.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Mrs. Gray invited our young minister to reside
at her house, it was probably with some vague
expectation of the result which followed; and when
her consent was desired to his union with Phebe, it
was given promptly, and with evident satisfaction.
But the young divine, though a meek and true Christian,
had a dignity of character and opinion which
sometimes proved at variance with the exactions of
an ambitious and arbitrary matron. She had expected
that he would continue to reside in her
family, after the marriage, and looked forward to
an extended dominion in her own household, and
increased influence in the church, to be secured by
this arrangement. But when he persisted in establishing
an independent home, in managing his own
salary, and becoming the sole protector of his future
wife, whose state of moral servitude he could not
witness without pain, Mrs. Gray’s enthusiasm in
favor of the match gradually subsided, and when
Malina insisted upon surrendering her newly acquired
property to the young couple, and giving
them the parsonage for a residence, the haughty
woman became stern in her opposition, and while
she took every means to render her own house an
unpleasant residence for the parties, found some excuse
to delay the wedding, from week to week, and
at last refused to sanction it, till Mr. Mosier should
be regularly installed in the pulpit, which he had
now filled almost a year. Still Mrs. Gray was not
a woman to talk openly of a change in her opinions.
She was too calculating and subtle for useless words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It had been settled in church council, that our
young minister should be installed a few weeks after
the time appointed for his marriage, and the young
couple submitted to the imposed delay without a
murmur. During these intervening weeks, and
while Malina was occupied in embellishing the parsonage,
Mrs. Gray was observed to be absent from
home more frequently than usual. There was
scarcely an influential church member near the old
meeting-house, with whom she had not taken her
knitting work, to spend a social afternoon; and
several tea-parties were given in a quiet way at her
own house, where she presided over the silver tea-urn,
and old fashioned china, with more than ordinary
condescension and dignity. But these were all
impromptu meetings, and invariably took place
when Mr. Mosier and Phebe were invited elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The parents of our young minister were aged and
very respectable farmers, residing in the vicinity of
New Haven; but they were far from wealthy, and
the farm they cultivated was not their own property.
A week before the Sabbath appointed for the installation,
Mr. Mosier accompanied his intended bride
and her mother on a visit to his parents, where the
haughty matron first learned that the man whom her
daughter was about to marry had been a <span class='it'>charity
student</span>. A benevolent society had paid his tuition
at Yale College, at least that portion which he had
been unable to meet by his own exertions. There
had been no concealment of this truth on his part, for
he had informed Phebe of the matter, and believed
Mrs. Gray already aware of it. But Phebe, in the
generous simplicity of her heart, never conceived it
possible that the manner of his education could be
deemed a cause of reproach, and it had left no impression
on her mind; to her upright understanding
there was no degradation in the thought that her
lover had been a <span class='it'>charity student</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray gave no demonstration of the displeasure
which filled her bosom on receiving this intelligence,
but she quietly made an excuse for returning
home with her daughter the next day, and, with every
appearance of disinterested kindness, insisted that
Mr. Mosier should not interrupt his visit to accompany
them. “She could easily drive home,” she
said, “the horse was gentle, and the roads perfectly
good; her son-in-law must remain with his family;
it would be cruel to force him away so abruptly.”
Mrs. Gray said all this in her usual manner, shook
hands with the old people, allowed the young divine
to assist her into the chaise, and pretended to be
very intently occupied in searching for something in
her traveling basket, while he placed Phebe in her
seat, and, with her slender hand clasped in his own,
was whispering his farewell.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Remember, and be in readiness next Sabbath,”
he said, in a low voice, “tell Malina that she must
take good care of you. I shall come on Saturday
evening.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe murmured that she would be ready; but as
she returned the farewell clasp of his hand, tears
started to her eyes. She could not have told the
reason, but a strange feeling of melancholy came
over her, and it seemed as if the parting were forever.
She looked back as the chaise drove away—he
was standing on the door step by his parents, and
the whole group waved their hands, smiling cheerfully,
as they saw her turn for a last glance. But
still her heart was heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What passed between Mrs. Gray and her daughter
during their drive home, we have no means of
recording. But as Malina sat in her chamber window,
and saw the chaise toiling up the hill that afternoon,
her sister leaned forward, and she caught a glimpse
of her face. It was white as marble, and stained
with tears. Malina had been ill, but she started up,
hastily girded her white morning wrapper to her
waist, and went down. Mrs. Gray loitered to give
some directions to the “hired man” about her horse,
and Phebe was descending from the chaise without
assistance. The moment her foot touched the earth,
she tottered, and would have fallen but for Malina,
who sprang forward, and flinging her arms around
her, inquired eagerly and kindly what had befallen
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe attempted to speak, but the words died on
her lips, and the color left them; she lifted her hand
as if to grasp at something for support, and fainted in
her sister’s arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, what is the matter?—where is Mr.
Mosier?—tell me, pray tell me, what has made poor
Phebe so ill, and why is she looking so wretched?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray turned, and saw that her child was
senseless.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Go and bring some water,” she said to the man,
“carry that basket in with you, and make haste.
Raise her head a little, you are crushing her bonnet,”
she continued, turning to Malina; “there,
take it off—she will come to, directly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she spoke, Mrs. Gray calmly untied her daughter’s
bonnet, and held it till the man came with water,
while Malina stood trembling beneath the weight of
the fainting girl, tenderly smoothing back the bright
tresses from her forehead, and wildly kissing her
pale lips, amid a thousand vague questions, which
no one thought of answering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray took a pitcher of water from the man,
who came panting from the well, and laving her
hands in it, laid them on the pale face which Malina
was still covering with tears and kisses. There was
a faint struggle, a gasping sigh, and after a little
Phebe began to murmur upon her sister’s bosom,
like one just awaking from a dream. She shrunk
from her mother, when that stubborn woman would
have assisted her to rise, and clinging to Malina,
walked with trembling steps toward the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, not there—up, to our own room, Malina,”
said the poor girl, as her sister would have led her
into the parlor. She was obliged to sit down more
than once in ascending the stairs; and when at
length Malina laid her upon the bed in their own
dear room, she looked sadly around, and reaching
up her arms, clasped the bending neck of her sister,
and began to weep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I must never see him again—never—never,” she
said, while her voice was broken with tears; “oh,
Malina, did you think any human being could be so
cruel?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina started, and for one instant a flash of pleasure
broke into her eyes. It was an unworthy feeling,
and the next moment her face was flooded with
shame that she had known it; and when she sat
down by her sister, and besought her to say what
had thus unnerved her, it was with as true sympathy
as ever warmed the heart of a noble and self-sacrificing
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The cause of her sorrow was soon explained.
Phebe had been commanded by her arbitrary mother
to give up all thoughts of a union with Mr. Mosier.
The gentle girl, for the first time in her life, had
ventured to expostulate with her parent. The hope
of her young life was at stake, and her heart trembled
at the thought of separation from the man whom
she had learned to love so devotedly. It was all in
vain. Mrs. Gray was resolved, her prejudices were
aroused, and to their gratification the happiness of
her child was as dust.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe had been educated with almost holy reverence
for the authority of a parent, and though her
heart broke, she dared not oppose her mother’s command.
Her spirit withered beneath it, like a flower
trodden to the earth, but she submitted. Not so Malina.
Once more she ventured to reason with and
oppose her mother, but only to call down resentment
on her own head. This was no sudden resolution in
Mrs. Gray; she had gone steadily to work, and
planned out her own results. She was one of those
cold pattern women who never know an impulse—whose
virtues are polished, like marble, and as cold.
She had paved her way quietly and well. The next
morning, while her two children were sorrowing in
their room, she was driving from house to house,
exerting her influence over better hearts and weaker
minds than her own, to the ruin of those who had
loved and trusted her. And while Phebe lay upon a
sick bed, a vestry council was called at the old
meeting-house, and a decision passed by a majority
of a single man, which deprived our young minister
of the pulpit he was to have taken as his own the
following Sabbath. Many good and just men of the
congregation protested against this cruel and unjust
act; but in churches, as in communities, the good
and the merciful do not always constitute a majority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decision of this church meeting was forwarded
to Mr. Mosier, and with it a letter from Mrs. Gray.
The next morning he rode by our cottage on horseback,
slowly, and as one in deep and morbid thought.
He crossed the old bridge, and, as he did so, looked
earnestly toward Mrs. Gray’s dwelling. He paused
a moment at the end, and then rode at a brisker pace
up the hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe had been feverish, and very low, all that
morning. Malina was watching by her side, and as
she lay with her eyes closed in an imperfect slumber,
the sound of a horse coming up the road made
her start from the pillow, and while her cheek burned
with a more feverish red, she fixed her eyes upon
the open sash.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is he—I know it!” she said, clasping her hand,
and looking into Malina’s face; “I will get up;
mother cannot refuse to let me see him this once;”
and with a kind of feverish joy the poor girl flung
aside the bed clothes, and stepped out on the floor.
With trembling and eager hands she gathered up her
beautiful tresses, and began to braid them about her
head, earnestly beseeching Malina all the time to assist
her in getting ready to go down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The kind hearted sister required no entreaty. She
helped to array the invalid, though her own breath
came gaspingly, and her hands shook like aspens in
performing their duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“There, now—there, I am ready. See, do I look
very ill, Malina?” said the excited young creature,
turning to her sister; “it will make his heart ache
to see how red my cheeks are. Do you think he
will detect the fever?” and dashing some lavender
over her handkerchief with an impetuosity all unlike
her usual quiet movements, the half delirious girl
took her sister’s arm, and was hurrying from the
room. But the sound of a horse, rapidly passing the
house, again came to her ear, and, with a faint exclamation,
she sprung to the window just in time to
catch a glimpse of her lover as he rode by. He
lifted his face to the open sash, and she saw that it
was very pale. He saw her, checked his horse
an instant, half raised his hand, and then turning
away with seeming effort, he rode slowly down the
hill.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He is gone,” exclaimed the unhappy girl, “gone
without a word, almost without a look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with a wavering step, Phebe Gray moved toward
the bed, and amid the confusion of her feverish
thoughts, she called on Malina to come and undo the
bridal wreath which was girding her forehead so
painfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Malina was away. She had caught one
glimpse at the pale face uplifted to her window,
and with a wild impulse to see the minister once
more, she flung a shawl over her head, and left the
room. With the speed of an antelope, she darted
through the garden, and forcing a passage through
the brushwood which lined a hollow beyond, leaped
down upon the natural basin of granite, where the
rock-spring poured its waves, just as he had dismounted,
and was proceeding to dip up the water in
his palm, and bathe his forehead with it. He looked
care-worn and pale, and the expression of his eyes,
as he dropped the water from his hand, and turned
them suddenly on the young girl, was that of a strong
heart in ruins, and with its energies prostrated. He
held forth his hand and tried to smile, but the attempt
was a painful one, and died in a faint quiver of the
lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina did not take his hand—she had no power—but
stood with her left foot half buried in the damp
moss which lined the spring, and the other planted
hard against the granite basin; her hands clasped
amid the drapery of her shawl, and her eyes lifted to
his, glittering with excitement, and yet full of tears.
The breath came pantingly through her unquiet lips,
and in the struggle of her emotions, the words of
greeting which she would have uttered, were broken
into sobs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“This is very kind of you, Miss Gray,” said the
young clergyman, in a low voice, which had something
of proud constraint in its tones; “I inquired
for you at the house, but your mother informed me
that you were engaged, and that your sister did not
wish to see me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not wish to see you!” exclaimed Malina, suddenly
finding voice; “Phebe—my poor Phebe—not
wish to see you! Alas, for her, she cannot see any
one; this cruel business has broken her heart. Oh,
Mr. Mosier, why is it that such wrong can be done?
why submit to it? what right has my mother thus to
interfere, to the unhappiness of her child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mosier did not reply, his thoughts were far
away, and, though he gazed earnestly on the enthusiastic
face lifted to his, Malina knew that he was
not thinking of her. She felt humbled, and turned
away her face as one who had been rebuked. So
she stood gazing, with a look of patient humility, on
the waters sparkling in the basin at her feet, till at
last he aroused himself and spoke. But she, who
felt every word he uttered as if it were a tone of music,
had no share in his speech or his thoughts.
Things all too precious for her were rendered to
another, and she must endure the pain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So she was ill, and <span class='it'>could</span> not come. Yet she
knew I was there, and sat in the room all the time.
I saw her at the window, and she looked—tell me,
Malina, my sweet, kind sister,” he added, suddenly,
“did she wish to see me?—would she come for a
moment here or into the garden?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The young man looked anxious, and his cheek
flushed brilliantly as he spoke, for the moment his
well regulated mind had lost its balance, and the
passions of earth were strong within him. It was
but for a moment; before Malina had time to reply,
the flush died from his face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No,” he added, with a sorrowful motion of the
head, “it is wrong to ask, foolish to desire an interview—comfort
her, Malina, say that which I cannot
have permission to utter in her presence; say how
deeply, how earnestly I have loved her, how weary
I am of the world, how lonely my heart is now—say
to her—alas! what message have I to send—I, who
can scarcely turn my face heavenward, the clouds
are so dark that lie heaped before me!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>These words were uttered in a tone of such despondency
that Malina once more lifted her eyes,
and would have spoken words of encouragement
which she was far from feeling, for her own wretchedness
seemed completed in that of the beings she
most loved; but, while her lips were parted, he made
a sudden effort at composure, and saying that all
might yet be well, in a broken and hurried voice, he
drew Malina toward him and stooped to press his
lips to her forehead, without seeming conscious of
the act—but she was all too conscious, the blood
rushed to her cheeks, and she trembled in his arms
like a frightened child. He saw it not, for to his
thought she was a sister only, and though his lips
had pressed her forehead for the first time, he did not
think of it, but mounted his horse and rode away before
she had power to utter a word or make a gesture
to detain him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He was gone forever, and she was alone—alone!
how often is that word misapplied; the loving and
the loved are never alone—but so it was with Malina
Gray.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“So, Madam, you refuse—my boy is dying, and
he yearns to look once more on the poor girl who
would have been his wife in a single week.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was but a few days after her interview with Mr.
Mosier, that Malina heard these words issue from
her mother’s parlor, as she was passing through the
hall, from the chamber where she had just left Phebe
striving to beguile her weary thoughts with a book.
The door was ajar, and there was a power in the
words which made her start and listen. It was a
deep, manly voice, that of an aged person, but entreaty,
tenderness and something almost like resentment,
combined to render it startling and pathetic.
Malina held her breath, and, drawing a step nearer,
looked through the door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An aged man was standing before her mother, he
held a cane without resting on it, and a broad brimmed
hat was in his left hand; firm and erect he stood
in the quiet room, the gray hair sweeping back from
his forehead, and his plain dress giving him the look
of a patriarch; his face was agitated, but so full of
benevolence that Malina loved the old man before
she guessed who he was. Violent passions could
seldom have passed over those mild features, still
they were disturbed as he spoke, and the good old
man was evidently struggling with strong and bitter
emotions. There was something in the grasp of his
hand on the cane, and in his dignified bearing, which
awed the sympathy it excited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray was sitting in her easy chair, looking
rather earnestly at the old man. She had been engaged
in knitting when he entered, but had laid the
work on a little round stand by her side, and seemed
rather anxious to take it up again; but she was too
punctilious for that, and very blandly requested her
visitor to resume the seat from which he had risen.
“No, I have not time to sit down, every minute is
worth years to me now—my only son is dying, and I
am absent from his side.” The old man now paused,
his chin began to quiver, and turning away his face,
he strove to conceal the tears that broke into his eyes
from the calm and heartless woman who sat gazing
upon him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Madam,” he said, but his voice was broken, and
his hand shook till the hat fell from his grasp to the
floor. “Madam, I beseech you, think better of this!
My boy cannot live forty-eight hours; the doctors
told me so before I left him. But I came from his
bed side, when each lost moment was as a drop of
blood wrung from my heart, thinking that you might
refuse any messenger but his father. You are a woman
and should feel for him, and here I gave up five
whole hours of this precious time that he might look
on the face of that poor girl before he dies; and his
mother—you have had children sleeping against
your heart, madam—do you think his mother would
not find it a comfort if the soul of her only child
could go up to heaven from her bosom where he
nestled in his first infancy? Do you think she has no
woman’s yearning wish for the last embrace, the last
endearing word? She loves the boy better than her
own soul, and he is dying before her eyes—but she
gave him up. When she saw that he moaned for
the presence of one who had become dearer than his
own mother, she bade me come hither and bring the
girl that her first born might die in the arms he loved
best—think, woman, every moment I spend in talking
here is wrung from the death bed of a child that
was all on earth that two old people had to love and
hope for. I must depart, but let <span class='it'>her</span> go with me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man unconsciously clasped his hands as
he spoke, and tears fell like rain over his withered
cheeks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray glanced at him with something of wonder
in her face, and extending out her hand, took up
the knitting work as if to end the conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And can you still refuse!” exclaimed the old man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It would not be proper,” replied Mrs. Gray,
quietly unscrewing the top of her silver knitting
case, “besides, Phebe is not well enough to ride so
far even if she desired it, and the fever may be contagious.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If I could talk with the young lady I am sure she
<span class='it'>would</span> desire it,” said the old man, almost humbly,
for his heart grew heavy at the thought of returning
to the death bed of his son with his errand unaccomplished.
“Leave it to her good feelings, madam, and
if they plead against me I will depart and trouble
you no more.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither the pleading voice, nor the agony of over-wrought
feelings with which the unhappy father
spoke, reached the heart of Mrs. Gray. While the
old man stood before her, trembling beneath the burden
of his grief, she placed her needle in its sheath,
twisted the worsted over her finger, and went through
the intricacies of a seam stitch before even her eyes
were lifted toward him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You must recollect, Mr. Mosier,” she said,
“Phebe is not at present engaged to your son, and
even if she were, I do not think it would be exactly
correct for her to visit him. I am sorry for the
young gentleman, very; I will see that our new minister
mentions his case in prayer next Sabbath; we all
feel for him—but he would not be advised. Indeed⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here Mrs. Gray dropped a stitch, and paused while
it was looped up again. When she raised her eyes,
the face of her auditor was stern, and as calm as her
own. The tears had dropped from his cheek, his
hands were both grasping the head of his cane, and
if that pharisaical woman could have shrunk from
any thing, the solemn and reproving eyes which
dwelt on her face would have kindled the most
generous blood of her heart into blushes of shame.
But it is hard to wring the die of shame from a self-righteous
heart. Mrs. Gray believed herself to be
acting in a most Christian-like spirit, in still retaining
the heartless civility of her manner toward the
poor old man whom her own cruelty had bereaved.
Her heart was entombed in the self-conceit of its
own sanctity, like dust in the marble of a sarcophagus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Woman,” said the old man, and this time his
voice was firm, and thrillingly solemn; “you have
no heart. You are a mother, and should know how
much worse than death it is to see the child whom
you have loved and cherished, and woven in your
very heart-strings, perishing before your eyes. Oh,
how proud we were of that boy! how his poor mother
loved him! what a day it was when she and I
walked up the broad aisle of that old meeting-house
yonder, and saw him standing in the pulpit—a minister
of the gospel. We had prayed for that sight—toiled
and slaved for it—and were so happy—so very
happy. He is on his death bed now. Woman, <span class='it'>you</span>
have sent him there—you, who were a mother,
thought nothing of smiting a sister woman through
the heart—you, a professor of religion, can do murder
more subtle and cruel than that which cleaves
a man through the brain, and look calm and speak
softly, nay, smilingly refuse the last dying request of
your victim. Woman, I will not curse you—that
right rests with the high God of Heaven, who looketh
down upon the murder you have done, not as
man looketh, not as the law looketh—before <span class='it'>him</span>,
shall you be arraigned, and that cold heart shall be
made to shudder at the depth of its own crime—<span class='it'>he</span>
will be thine accuser—he, thy victim, who was so
gentle, so sweet tempered, that thoughts of revenge
never entered his heart. In a few short hours he
will stand in the broad light of Heaven, sent there
untimely; and even as Abel bear witness against his
brother, he shall bear witness against thee! The
Almighty may not place his mark upon thy brow—the
law may not brand thee—but one who can wring
the life from a human being by silent and moral
cruelty, is not less a murderer than the man who
smites his brother to the heart with a poniard!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Gray was at length moved—for the solemn
and stern energy of that pale old man might have
startled the dead from their graves—the knitting
dropped from her hands, her eyes darkled with terror,
and her face turned white as a corpse beneath
the snowy lace and the black and false hair that
shaded it. She would have spoken, but the pallid
lips trembled without uttering a sound, while the
hands which rested in her lap began to shiver, as she
strove to lift them and motion him away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The old man left her where she sat, and went into
the hall; but his feelings had been too cruelly outraged,
and there his strength gave way; he sunk
helplessly to a settee, and covering his face with his
hands, wept like a child.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina had left the hall and stood in her sister’s
chamber. Phebe was dressed and seated by the
window, pondering over the pages of a book, though
she had not turned a leaf that day. She did not raise
her eyes when the door opened, but seemed unconscious
of a second person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come with me,” said Malina, grasping the hand
which lay in her sister’s lap, with fingers that clung
to it like ice. “Come!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was something in Malina’s face that frightened
her companion from the apathy that had for
days settled on her spirits. She arose, without a
word, and was led down stairs, and into the hall.
It was empty. Old Mr. Mosier had departed, and
the front door was left open behind him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Phebe,” said Malina Gray, in a faint whisper,
“<span class='it'>he</span> is dying, and has sent for you—his father sat
there, but a moment since. Our mother has refused
that you should see him. He is pining to die with
his head against your heart. Sister, will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will plead with her—kneel to her,” said Phebe
Gray, and opening the parlor door, she entered
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina paused an instant, and turning through a
side door, passed across a small clover lot, toward
the stables. A horse stood cropping the white blossoms
in a corner of the field. She looked around for
some one to help her, but the men were all away on
the upper farm—so she drew toward the gentle animal,
and beckoning with her hand, uttered a few
coaxing words, and persuaded him toward the
stables. He bent his neck while her trembling
hands placed the bit in his mouth, which was yet
half full of fragrant grass, and turned his head to
watch her, as she girded the saddle to his back.
When she tied him to the garden fence, and entered
the house again, he followed her with his eyes, and,
with a short neigh, fell to tearing with his mouth the
honeysuckle vines that crept along the fence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Malina entered the hall she saw Phebe gliding
up stairs toward their room; she was walking feebly,
and held by the bannister as she went. When the
sisters stood within the chamber together, Phebe
sunk to a chair, while Malina looked earnestly in
her face, and uttered a single sentence⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you go?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She has forbidden it,” replied Phebe, faintly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you go?” said Malina, once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare not disobey her!” Phebe spoke with difficulty,
and clasping both hands over her face, moaned
as if in pain, for the struggle within her heart was
terrible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Phebe became sufficiently composed to look
up, her sister was gone. She was glad to be alone,
and creeping toward the bed, knelt down and prayed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina had snatched a bonnet and shawl from the
bed while her sister’s face was concealed, and gliding
down stairs into the open air, she mounted the
horse and rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was sunset as the poor girl came slowly over the
old bridge, and rode by our house. I was playing in
the front yard, and ran out to meet her—but all at
once she drew the bridle tight, and the spirited horse
sprung forward on the way before my childish voice
could be heard. The gloom of coming night lay
heavily amid the pine boughs, as the young girl rode
under them, and when she dashed up the road, and
disappeared over Fall’s Hill, both horse and rider
were for one moment displayed in bold relief against
a pile of crimson and golden clouds which lay heaped
in the horizon. When she disappeared, it seemed,
to my infant fancy, as if the gates of heaven had unfolded
to receive her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The night came on clear, and lighted both by moon
and stars, the solitary traveler still kept the road,
accompanied only by her spirited animal, and the
shadow which seemed gliding along the dewy green-sward
by her side, like a silent guardian. It was
late in the evening when the horse checked himself
at the fence before a red farm-house, with a sloping
roof, and two large trees embowering it with foliage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seemed like supernatural instinct in the animal,
for he had only been there once before, and Malina,
in the tumult of her thoughts, scarcely knew where
she wished to stop. There was a light twinkling
through the thick leaves of a tree bough that dropped
over one of the front windows, but it was very faint,
and seemed forcing itself through the folds of a window
curtain. Malina grasped the horn of her saddle,
and dropping feebly down to the green-sward, moved
toward the house. There was a foot-path which led
to the front door—she followed this, and found herself
in a dark entry, with a narrow stream of light
falling through the entrance to an inner room. The
sound of a faint, wandering voice, and of smothered
sobs, stole from the room. Malina breathed heavily
as she touched the door, and glided into the room.
It was indeed the chamber of death. A solitary
candle burned on the table, amid glasses and vials,
sending forth just sufficient light to reveal an old
fashioned tent bed, with its white drapery sweeping
to the floor, and its heavy fringes hanging motionless,
as if they had been cut from marble. At the
foot of this bed knelt an old man; his hands were
clasped beneath his face, and the long gray hair
swept thickly over them, as he prayed. A female
stood between Malina and the bed; she was bending
over the pillows which were heaped high upon
it, and though the poor girl could not see her face,
she <span class='it'>felt</span> that it was <span class='it'>his</span> mother. She moved, and the
sound of her footstep on the sanded floor made the
old lady lift her head, and Malina saw his face once
more. Oh, how white and changed it was! The
damp, black hair fell heavily over his forehead,
shadows lay about the closed eyelids, and there was
an expression about the mouth, which was not a
smile, and yet seemed deathly and sweet. His head
was raised high with pillows, and though he seemed
to sleep, the breath came painfully from his lips, and
with a struggle that constantly disturbed the linen
which lay in waves across his breast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina stood upright in the dim light, motionless
as a thing of marble, her eyes fixed on the dying
man, and unconscious, in the force of her grief, that
to all in the room, save him who saw her not, she
was a stranger, and had intruded into the sanctuary
of private grief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It mattered not; Malina’s step had been mistaken
for that of a woman from the kitchen, and no one
knew that the wretched young creature was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a motion of the bed clothes, a faint
murmur, and the dying man opened his eyes—those
large, eloquent eyes that Malina had thought upon
so often, and so thrillingly. There was a mist upon
them now, but through it broke a soft and strange
light, heavenly and beautiful. The old lady bent her
ear, and listened to the faint murmur, which seemed
dying on his lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father—when will he come back?—it is
late!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sound was very faint, but the old man had
heard it amid the strong agony of his prayer. He
arose, and moving round the bed, bent over his son.
A light, almost preternatural, came to the eyes of
that dying man, and with a sudden effort he found
voice to speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My father,” he said, “thank God—you have returned
in time. Where is she?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My son,” said the old man, in a voice which he
vainly strove to render calm, “in a little time she
will meet you in heaven—but she is not here.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The invalid had turned his head upon the pillow,
with a look of touching eagerness; but it fell back—his
eyes closed faintly, and after gasping once or
twice, he lay motionless, save the lips, which gave
forth broken but beautiful fragments of speech, such
as came uppermost in his pure, but wandering mind,
for he was delirious now. The last vibrations of his
soul were disturbed by disappointment in his sole
earthly wish. In the broken murmurs that fell from
his lips, Malina heard her own name, and it unlocked
the ice which seemed closing round her
heart. With a sob that broke to her lips amid a
gush of tears, she sprung toward the bed, and falling
upon her knees, clasped the pale hand which fell
over the bed, and pressed her quivering lips repeatedly
upon it, while her voice mingled with the choking
grief that shook her whole frame.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Forgive me! oh, let me stay!” she said, lifting
her face to the old woman, but still nervously grasping
the dying man’s hand; “I loved him better than
she did—better than anybody could—better than my
own soul! Let me stay, and die with him! No one
asked <span class='it'>me</span> to come, but I am here. You will not send
me away?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voice of Malina Gray was soft and low, like
that of her sister; and though broken with grief, it
is probable that the dying man was bewildered by
the sound. He started from the pillow—a glorious
lustre broke through the mist which whelmed his
eyes, and as Malina sprang to her feet, his face fell
upon her shoulder, and his cold cheek lay against
hers. It was very strange—Malina knew that he
was dying, but a flash of wild joy thrilled through
her heart, and for the first time since she had heard
of his illness, a faint color broke into the cheek
which pressed his. She laid him gently upon the
pillow, and parting the damp hair from his forehead,
pressed her lips tremblingly upon it, while her sobs
filled the chamber. When the dying man felt the
touch of her quivering mouth, a smile stole over his
face—again the misty eyes were unclosed, and feebly
lifting his arm, he wound it over her neck and drew
her to his bosom, while the unformed words he would
have spoken were lost amid the dying music of his
soul. A moment, and his arm fell softly from Malina’s
neck. The young creature lifted her face
from his bosom, and looking at his mother, murmured⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“He loved <span class='it'>her</span> living—but is he not mine in death?—mine,
for ever and ever!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She turned to lay her face near his heart once
more, but there was no color in her lips then. She
started, and, with a cold shudder, bent her cheek
slowly to his bosom—it pressed heavily, and more
heavily, on the cold clay—her limbs relaxed, and
she sunk across the bed, senseless as the beautiful
corpse which cumbered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The gloom of death had shadowed that farm-house
two days, and now it was desolate. The kind neighbors
who had walked in and out, ministering to grief,
no longer broke the solemn hush which pervaded the
dwelling. The departed was indeed the departed—for
they had borne him over his father’s threshold,
and laid him down to sleep in the dark earth. Malina
followed him to the grave. She was a stranger,
but no one asked why she stood among the mourners,
and without their sable vestments. When the aged
mother bent over the coffin, and looked upon the
dead, the young girl drew to her side, and fixed her
eyes upon the cold still face which had never met her
glance coldly before. The mother wept, but Malina
could not shed a tear, although the solemn and hushed
grief upon her face awed even village curiosity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now they were alone—the parents, and that
poor girl. She was upon her knees—her head was
bent, and its redundant hair veiled her face, while
the broken hearted young creature begged a blessing
from <span class='it'>his mother</span> before she went away. The sorrowing
woman laid her hands upon the bright tresses
which flowed over her lap for a moment, then lifting
the suppliant to her bosom, wept over her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Mosier, when he heard the sobs of his wife,
arose, and clasping his hands over Malina’s head,
silently besought a blessing on her. She drew back,
and he saw that her face was still calm; so taking
her hands in his, he began to persuade and reason
with her. She listened, and gazed earnestly in his
face as he spoke. At last, tears started to her eyes,
and when the old man saw this, big drops began to
stream down his own cheek, and the clasp of his
hand grew tremulous, as he led her from the room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the old man placed Malina in her saddle, he
glanced in her face, and a misgiving came to his
heart. He questioned himself if it was safe to trust
her to the road without protection; but when he proposed
accompanying her part of the way, at least,
she pleaded against it with startling eagerness, and,
thinking of his afflicted wife, he allowed her to depart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina had a secret wish at her heart, which
caused it to pant for solitude. Her road lay close by
the grave-yard where our young minister was buried,
and she yearned to stand once more by his death
place, and alone. When she reached the sacred
place, she looked to the right and left, timidly, as if
her errand had been a wrong one. Her nerves were
strung to their utmost tension, and she was morbidly
fearful of being seen—every thing was solitary and
quiet; the long grass bending to the breeze, as it
sighed over the graves, and the soft rustling sound
which whispered amid the leaves of a clump of
weeping willows, that curtained an entire household
that had gone down to sleep together, were all the
sounds that fell upon her ear. She tied the horse to
the fence, and passing forward to <span class='it'>his</span> grave, sat upon
a pile of sods that had been left by the sexton. She
neither wept nor moved—but there she remained in
the bright sunshine, gazing hour after hour on a tuft
of tiny white blossoms, which sprung up from a sod
which they had placed just over his heart. Now
and then, she twined her hands together as they reposed
in her lap—and as the sunshine went suddenly
away, and heavy black clouds rolled over the sky,
with the lightning playing amid their ragged folds,
she smiled, and drew closer to the grave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, a roar of thunder burst from the clouds,
big drops of rain came down upon the graves, and
bent the willows more droopingly to the earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina lifted her eyes upward with a wild and
startled look, then turning them on the willows
which sheltered that single family, and on the congregation
of graves which lay around her, all covered
with long grass, she rested them on the mound at
her feet, murmuring⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Have all a covering from the cold rain, but thee?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As she spoke, Malina took off her shawl, and
spreading it over the newly made grave, cast herself
upon it, and for the first time since she felt his
heart stop beating beneath hers, moaned and sobbed
as if her very life were going from her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a few moments the garments of our poor mourner
were saturated with rain—still she clung closer to the
grave, murmuring words of wild endearment to the
unconscious inmate, and congratulating herself, with
strange earnestness, that she was still able to shield
his bosom from the storm.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At last, the clouds rolled away, and though the sun
was just going down, his last fires kindled a rainbow
amid the water drops that yet filled the air. Malina
lifted her head, and gazed upward—a smile parted
her lips when she saw the rainbow, and pressing her
cheek upon the grave again, she whispered⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The angels have built thee a bridge, love!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sun went down, and Malina arose from the
grave, shivering from head to foot. She gazed
around, and was turning her eyes with a wistful
look on her late resting place, as if she meditated
casting herself down again, when a low neigh from
the horse which still remained by the fence, aroused
her, and leaving the shawl behind, she hurried toward
the patient animal, and mounting him, rode away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina must have wandered from the usual road,
in the strange abstraction of her mind, for it was
midnight when she came opposite the old meeting-house.
Prompted, doubtless, by some vague fear of
returning home, or perhaps allured to pause by the
open gate, the weary and half bewildered girl
turned her horse, and riding close to the front door
of the parsonage house, dismounted, and allowed
him to wander amid the flower beds and rose bushes
which filled the yard. Thrusting her hand beneath
the door sill, she took out a key, and fitted it to the
lock, but with difficulty, for her hands trembled; and
though hot flushes every moment darted through her
frame, she was shivering with cold. She went up
stairs, holding feebly by the balusters, and guided
by the moonlight, which fell from a window overhead,
she entered a room—that which she had
decorated as the bridal chamber of her sister Phebe,
and of the departed. A clear moonlight came
through the windows, and lay like flags of silver
amid the black shadows which filled the apartment.
Every thing was still and motionless; not a breath
stirred the bridal ribands with which the muslin curtains
were looped back. The bed lay with the
moonlight sleeping amid its pillows, like a snow
drift, when the air is calm; and the atmosphere was
impregnated by the dead flowers which had been
profusely lavished on the toilet, and now hung crisp
and withered in their vases. Malina was very ill,
and a fever burned through her veins—her limbs
were almost powerless, and her forehead seemed
girdled with iron. Still was she sensible of surrounding
things, and her heart swelled with the
recollections which thronged on her aching brain.
She unfastened her damp dress, and with difficulty
crept into bed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Poor, poor Phebe,” she murmured, gathering
the white counterpane over her shivering form,
“how little she thinks I am here—how she would
pity me, so ill, and all alone. Alas, how sad a thing
this trouble is—I have not thought of Phebe these
many long days—I wonder if she is ill as I am—if
her head is so hot, and her limbs chilled, till they
shake so. This is a cold bed—very, very cold—but
his is colder still. Oh, my God! <span class='it'>he is dead</span>—and I
have seen his grave. I—but it was not me—no—he
loved my sister. But I had his dying kiss! It was
the last throb of his heart that beat against mine, and
chilled me so. That was it—that was it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With such fragments of speech, and moans of
pain, Malina verged into the delirium of a raging
fever. At times she would weep, and call for her
sister, in tones of yearning tenderness—then notes
of music would break from her lips, and ring
through every corner of the solitary house, as if a
prisoned angel were pleading for release there.
When the fever came on, fierce and strong, she
began to ask for water—to weep, and wring her
hands, while she entreated some visionary being to
leave her in the grave-yard where <span class='it'>he</span> was; where
showers were continually falling and weaving rainbows
around those who thirsted for rest or drink;
and so her voice of suffering rose and swelled
through the lone building all night. When the day
dawned, she was still awake and delirious; tears
stood on her crimson cheeks, and entreaties for
water still rose to her parched lips.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It came at last—she knew not how it was, but a
pale, sweet face bent over her, a soft voice was
speaking comfort, and a glass of water cooler and
more refreshing than she had ever tasted before was
held to her lips. She was just conscious enough to
think that it was Phebe who ministered to her wants,
or some good seraph that looked as sweetly sad and
kind. Then she sunk to sleep, and it was many weeks
before she awoke from the dream that followed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was Phebe Gray who stood by the sick bed of
the sufferer. A villager had seen Mrs. Gray’s horse
that morning, bridled and with his saddle on, trampling
among the flower beds and feasting upon the
choice rose bushes which grew in the parsonage
yard—he went in to secure the animal and was terrified
by the voice of suffering which issued from the
house. He went up stairs, saw the delirious young
creature who occupied the bridal chamber, and
hastened to inform Mrs. Gray—but Phebe had struggled
with her own sufferings and stood over Malina’s
sick bed many hours before the mother had arranged
her dress and prepared herself to pass through the
village with that degree of propriety which she
considered due to her character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Malina lay many weeks before the fever left her;
then a cough set in and a hectic spot settled and
burned into her thin cheeks. The poor girl smiled
a sad quiet smile, when she heard them say each evening,
that a little over exertion had excited her, that
she had taken a slight cold which in the turn of her
disease was felt more than usual. Still the cough
deepened, the crimson spot burned on, and she knew
that the life which kindled would soon be exhausted.
And so it was, that autumn when the woods were all
flushed with those dyes which an early frost brings
to the foliage, when the nuts were ripe and the brown
leaves fell in showers over the crisp moss, Malina
Gray was extended beneath the snowy drapery which
her own hands had gathered above the bridal bed.
White ribands were still knotted amid the folds which
seemed brooding over her like a cloud, and a few
crimson fall flowers lay scattered upon the pillow,
some of them so close to the marble cheek that a
faint tinge was coldly reflected there. For two
whole nights Phebe watched the beautiful clay reposing
in the dim light upon her own bridal bed, but
scarcely more changed than her own sweet self.
Malina was the happiest, her heart had broken amid
the struggle of its suffering, but that of the watcher
lay crushed and withering in her young bosom. She
felt that life was yet strong within her; but hope,
love, every thing that makes life pleasant to a woman,
had departed. She was still good, still pure almost as
an angel, but the sad smile which settled on her lips
never deepened to a laugh again, and no human being
ever saw a tear in her changeless and sorrowful eyes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>They laid Malina Gray down to sleep beside old
minister Brown—in the very spot she had yearned
to repose in. A large circle of neighbors gathered
around the grave, some in tears, and all very sorrowful.
Mrs. Gray stood by the coffin; her mourning
was arranged with great care, and a veil of new
crape, deeply hemmed, fell decorously over her
face, and the white handkerchief, with which she
concealed those maternal tears proper for a mother,
whose duty it was to be resigned under any dispensation.
But Phebe stood silent and motionless; no
handkerchief was lifted to her eyes, and the face
which gleamed beneath the crape veil, was profoundly
calm, almost as that of the corpse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We had a new minister, on trial, of Mrs. Gray’s
choosing, who performed the funeral service, and
when all was over, returned home with the mourners;
when they knelt in the little parlor that night,
he prayed earnestly, and with genuine tears, for the
bereaved mother; he besought the Lord to visit,
with consolation, one who was a mother in Israel, a
bright and shining ornament in the Christian church;
a woman who had brought up her children in the
fear and admonition of the Lord; whose path was
growing brighter and brighter to the perfect day
when she would reap a rich reward in heaven.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Amid a few natural sobs which awoke in the
widow’s heart, she murmured, “Amen,” satisfied
that her life had been one of perfect rectitude, and
that in all things she had been a pattern mother, and
an ornament to the church, which ought to be her
consolation under any bereavement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The new minister was a very conscientious man,
but practical in all his ideas; he was honest in the
high opinion which he entertained of Mrs. Gray, and
not sufficiently sensitive to shrink from offering his
hand to Phebe, when that lady delicately gave him
to understand that the step would be satisfactory to
herself. The old parsonage house was still empty,
and Phebe’s inheritance. He was an installed pastor,
and Miss Gray’s engagement to his predecessor
never entered his mind as an objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Phebe betrayed no emotion when the proposal was
made. She simply declined it, without giving a
reason; and when he married another person, and
would have rented the parsonage, she said with
decision—“It must remain as my sister left it!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And when Mrs. Gray would have remonstrated,
she answered, still with firmness⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I am of age, mother, but still will obey you in
all things else. Act as you like regarding the other
property—but no stranger shall ever live in the parsonage.
Poor Malina furnished it for <span class='it'>him</span>, and for
me. She died there, and so will I!”</p>

<hr class='tbk107'/>

<p class='pindent'>It may be so, for the old house is still uninhabited.
Every thing remains as Malina left it; the bridal
chamber, the easy chair, and the flute upon the
table; time has made little change in those silent
apartments, for every week Phebe, who has become
a calm and sorrowful old maid, goes up to the house
alone, and remains there for many hours; sometimes
seated at the study table, and gazing at a
grave which may be seen through the trees. Once,
a child gathering valley lilies, beneath the window,
saw her standing at the open sash, with her sad eyes
turned toward the grave-yard. She was talking to
herself—the child dropped his flowers and listened,
for there was something so mournful in her voice,
that his little heart thrilled to the sound.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They tell me that he wearied himself, and died
of fever,” she said; “and that thou, my sister, perished
naturally, and as we all must. Alas, if I could
but think so. Why not have told me how he was
beloved before it was too late? I would have given
him up—and while you were happy, this heart had
not become so palsied and feelingless. Alas, it was
well that thy heart <span class='it'>could</span> break, my poor, poor
Malina!”</p>

<p class='line0'>Their broadening leaves grow glossier, and their sprays</p>

<p class='line0'>And creak of engines lifting ponderous bulks,</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>A MOTHER’S INFLUENCE.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother! mother!” exclaimed a sweet, eager
voice, and the speaker, a child of thirteen years,
burst into the room, where Mrs. Carlton sat at work,
“don’t you think there is to be a prize given on
exhibition day for the best composition! And I mean
to try for it—sha’nt I?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was a little, harum-scarum looking imp! I
suppose she had run all the way home from school,
for her straw bonnet hung on her neck instead of
her head, and a profusion of soft dark hair was
streaming in such disorder about her glowing face,
that you could not tell if she were pretty or not; but
you could see a pair of brilliant, gray or blue or black
eyes—they certainly changed their color with every
new emotion; but I think they were really gray—full
of laughter, and love beaming through the truant
tresses, and all eloquent with the beauty of a fresh,
warm soul. This change in the child’s eyes is no
freak of a foolish fancy; for every one noticed it;
and her school-crony, Kate Sumner, used to declare,
that when Harriet was angry they were black; gray
when she was thoughtful; violet when sad; and
when happy and loving, they changed to the tenderest
blue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carlton drew the little girl toward her, and
smoothed back the rebellious curls, at the same time
exclaiming, with a long drawn sigh, “My <span class='it'>dear</span>
Harriet! how you <span class='it'>do</span> look!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, mother! it’s not the least matter how <span class='it'>I</span> look!
If I were only a beauty, now, like Angelina Burton,
I would keep my hair as smooth as—as <span class='it'>any</span> thing;
but I wouldn’t rub my cheeks though, as she does
always, just before she goes into a room where
there’s company—would <span class='it'>you</span>, mother?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The mother gazed at her child’s expressive face,
as she spoke, with its irregular, yet lovely features,
the strange, bright eyes, the changing cheek, the full
and sweet, but spirited mouth, and said to herself,
“Whatever you may think, my darling, I would not
change your simple, innocent, childlike unconsciousness,
for all Angelina’s beauty, spoiled as it is by
vanity and affectation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, mother, do give me a subject for composition,
for I want to write it now, this minute!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Harriet,” said Mrs. Carlton quietly, “go and
brush your hair, change your shoes, and mend that
rent in your dress as neatly as you can.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet half pouted; but she met her mother’s
tranquil eye; the pout changed to a good-humored
smile, and kissing her affectionately, she bounded
off to do her bidding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While she is gone, you would like—would you not,
dear reader?—to ask a few questions about her. I
can guess what they are, and will answer them, to
the best of my knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carlton is a widow, with a moderate fortune,
and a handsome house in Tremont street, Boston.
She has been a star in fashionable life, but since
the loss of her husband, whom she tenderly loved,
she has retired from the gay world, and devoted
herself to her child—a wild, frank, happy, generous
and impetuous creature, with half a dozen glaring
faults, and one rare virtue which nobly redeemed
them all. That virtue, patient reader, you must find
out for yourself. Perhaps you will catch a glimpse
of it in</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>AUNT ELOISE.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Harriet was busy with her composition, when her
aunt, who was on a visit to Mrs. Carlton, entered
the room. Aunt Eloise was a weak minded and weak
hearted lady of a very uncertain age—unhappily
gifted with more sensibility than sense. She really
had a deal of feeling—for herself—and an almost inexhaustible
shower of tears, varied occasionally by
hysterics and fainting-fits, whenever any pressing
exigency in the fate of her friends demanded self-possession,
energy, or immediate assistance. If, too,
there happened, as there will sometimes, in all households,
to be an urgent necessity for instant exertion
by any member of the family, such as sewing, watching
with an invalid, shopping with a country cousin,
poor Aunt Eloise was invariably and most unfortunately
seized with a sudden toothache, headache, pain
in the side, strange feelings, dreadful nervousness, or
some trouble of the kind, which quite precluded the
propriety of asking her aid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every morning at breakfast Aunt Eloise edified
the family with a wonderful dream, which the breakfast-bell
had interrupted, and every evening she grew
sentimental over the reminiscences which the twilight
hour awakened. It was then that innumerable
shades of former admirers arose. Some doubted if
they had ever been <span class='it'>more</span> than shades; but Aunt
Eloise certainly knew best about that, and who had a
right to deny, that Mr. Smith had knelt to her for
pity; that Colonel Green had vowed eternal adoration;
and that Lawyer Lynx had laid his heart, his
hand, and his fees, which were not quite a fortune,
at her feet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Eloise had been—at least she hinted so—a
beauty and a blue, in her day; and, to maintain both
characters, she rouged, wore false ringlets, and scribbled
love-verses, which she had a bad habit of leaving,
by accident, between the leaves of books in
every frequented room of the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She thought and avowed herself extravagantly fond
of her niece, during her early childhood, and imagined
that she displayed a graceful enthusiasm in exclaiming,
every now and then, in her presence, and
in that of others, “Oh! you angel child! I do think
she is the sweetest creature! Come here and kiss
me, you beauty!” &amp;c. &amp;c. But no one ever saw
Aunt Eloise taking care of the child, attending to its
little wants, or doing any thing for its benefit. The
only tangible proof of her affection for her niece,
was in the shape of bonbons and candy, which she
was in the habit of bringing home from her frequent
walks in Tremont street. Harriet regularly handed
these forbidden luxuries to her mother, and Mrs.
Carlton as regularly threw them in the fire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Isn’t it a pity to waste such nice things, mother?
Why not give them to some poor child in the street?”
asked the little girl one day, as she watched, with
longing eyes, a paper full of the tempting poison,
which her mother was quietly emptying into the
grate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carlton did not disdain to reason with her
child—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“That would be <span class='it'>worse</span> than wasted, dear. It
would be cruel to give to another what I refuse to
you on account of its unwholesomeness.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But Harriet had now been for a long time out of
the spinster’s books—as the saying is—and this misfortune
occurred as follows—</p>

<p class='pindent'>One morning, when she was about six years old,
the child came into her mother’s room from her
aunt’s, where she had been alternately pelted, scolded,
and teased, till she was weary, and, seating herself
in a corner, remained for some time absorbed in
thought. She had been reading to her mother that
morning, and one sentence, of which she had asked
an explanation, had made a deep impression upon
her. It was this—“God sends us trials and troubles
to strengthen and purify our hearts.” She now sat
in her corner, without speaking or stirring, until her
mother’s voice startled her from her reverie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Of what are you now thinking, Harriet?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Mother, did God send Aunt Eloise to strengthen
and purify my heart?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What do you mean, my child?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, the book says he sends trials for that, and
she is the greatest trial <span class='it'>I</span> have, you know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The indignant maiden was just entering the room
as this dialogue began, and hearing her own name,
she had stopped, unseen, to listen. Speechless with
rage, she returned to her chamber, and was never
heard to call Harriet an angel child again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But we have wasted more words on the fair Eloise’s
follies than they deserve. Let us return to Harriet’s
all-important composition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The maiden-lady, selfish and indolent as she was,
took it into her head sometimes to be exceedingly inquisitive;
and officious too, particularly where she
thought her literary talents could come into play.
She walked up to Harriet and looked over her
shoulder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What’s this, hey? oh! a story! That’s right,
Harriet, I am glad to see you taking to literary pursuits.
Come, child! give me the pen and I will improve
that sentence for you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank you, aunt! but I don’t want it improved.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not want it improved! There’s vanity!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Indeed, aunt, I am not vain about it, and I
would like you to help me, if it were not to be
shown as mine. It wouldn’t be fair, you know,
to pass off another’s as my own. I am writing for
a prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“For a prize! So much the more reason that you
should be assisted. There, dear, run away to your
play and I will write it all for you. You’ll be sure
to win the prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>With every word thus uttered, Harriet’s eyes had
grown larger and darker, and at the close, she turned
them, full of astonishment, from her aunt’s face to
her mother’s. Reassured by the expression of the
latter, she replied,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But, Aunt Eloise, that would be a falsehood, you
know.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“A falsehood, miss!” cried the maiden, sharply,
“It is a very common thing, I assure you!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But not the less false for being common, Eloise,”
said Mrs. Carlton; “pray let Harriet have her own
way about it. It would be far better to lose the prize,
than to gain it thus dishonestly.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Eloise, as usual, secretly determined to have
<span class='it'>her</span> own way; but she said no more then, and Harriet
pursued her employment without further interruption.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-top:1em;'>——</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-size:0.9em;'>THE PRIZE.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exhibition day had arrived. Harriet had
finished her story several days before, and read it to
her mother. It was a simple, graceful, childlike
effusion, with less of pretension and ornament, and
more of spirit and originality than the compositions
of most children of the same age contain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Carlton seemed much pleased; but Aunt
Eloise had criticised it without mercy. At the same
time she was observed to smile frequently with a
cunning, sly, triumphant expression, peculiar to herself—an
expression which she always wore when
she had a secret, and secrets she had, in abundance—a
new one almost every day—trivial, petty secrets,
which no one cared about but herself; but which
<span class='it'>she</span> guarded as jealously as if they had been apples
of gold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The exhibition day had arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Good bye, mother; good bye, aunty,” said Harriet,
glancing for a moment into the breakfast-room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was looking very pretty in a simple, tasteful
dress, made for the occasion. She held the story in
her hand, neatly enclosed in an envelope, and her
eyes were full of hope—the cloudless hope of childhood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Don’t be surprised, Harriet,” said her aunt, “at
any thing that may happen to-day. Only be thankful
if the prize is yours, that’s all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“If Kate Sumner don’t win it, I do <span class='it'>hope</span> I shall!”
replied the eager child, and away she tripped to
school.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At twelve o’clock Mrs. Carlton and her sister took
their seats among the audience, in the exhibition
room. The usual exercises were completed, and it
only remained for the compositions to be read aloud
by the teacher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first was a sentimental essay upon Friendship.
Mr. Wentworth, the teacher, looked first surprised,
then amused, then vexed as he read, while a gaily
and fashionably dressed lady, who occupied a conspicuous
place in the assembly, was observed to
toss her head and fan herself with a very complacent
air, while she met, with a nod, the conscious eyes
of a fair and beautiful, but haughty looking girl of
fifteen seated among the pupils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“By Angelina Burton,” said the teacher, as he
concluded, and laying it aside without further comment,
he took up the next—“Lines to a Favorite
Tree,” by Catherine Sumner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was short and simple, and ran as follows⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next was a story, and Harriet Carlton’s eyes
and cheeks changed color as she listened. It was
the same, yet not the same! The incidents were
hers, the sentiment more novel-like, and many a
flowery and highly wrought sentence had been
introduced, which she had never heard before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She sat speechless with wonder, indignation, and
dismay, and though several other inferior compositions
were read, she was so absorbed in reverie, that
she heard no more until she was startled by Mr.
Wentworth’s voice calling her by name. She looked
up. In his hand was the prize—a richly chased,
golden pencil-case, suspended to a chain of the same
material. The sound, the sight recalled her bewildered
faculties, and ere she reached the desk, she
had formed a resolution, which, however, it required
all her native strength of soul to put in practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Carlton, the prize is yours!” and the teacher
leaned forward to throw the chain around her neck.
The child drew back⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“No, sir,” she said in a low, but firm and distinct
voice, looking up bravely in his face, “I did not
write the story you have read.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Not write it!” exclaimed Mr. Wentworth, “Why,
then, does it bear your name? Am I to understand,
Miss Carlton, that you have asked another’s assistance
in your composition, and that you now repent
the deception?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Harriet! this was too much! Her dark eyes
first flashed, and then filled with tears; her lip trembled
with emotion, and she paused a moment, as if
disdaining a reply to this unmerited charge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A slight and sneering laugh from the beauty aroused
her, and she answered, respectfully but firmly,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The story, I did write, was in that envelope yesterday.
Some one has changed it without my knowledge.
It was not so good as that you have read; so
I must not take the prize.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a murmur of applause through the
assembly, and the teacher bent upon the blushing
girl a look of approval, which amply repaid her for
all the embarrassment she had suffered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Aunt Eloise took advantage of the momentary
excitement to steal unobserved from the room. Harriet
took her seat, and Miss Angelina Burton was
next called up. The portly matron leaned smilingly
forward; and the graceful, little beauty, already
affecting the airs of a fine lady, sauntered up to the
desk and languidly reached out her hand for the
prize.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I cannot say much for your taste in selection,
Miss Burton. I do not admire your author’s sentiments.
The next time you wish to make an extract,
you must allow me to choose for you. There are
better things than this, even in the trashy magazine
from which you have copied it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And with this severe, but justly merited reproof of
the imposition that had been practiced, he handed
the young lady, not the prize, which she expected,
but the MS. essay on Friendship, which she had
copied, word for word, from an old magazine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The portly lady turned very red, and the beauty,
bursting into tears of anger and mortification,
returned to her seat discomfited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Miss Catherine Sumner,” resumed the teacher,
with a benign smile, to a plain, yet noble-looking
girl, who came forward as he spoke, “I believe
there can be no mistake about <span class='it'>your</span> little effusion. I
feel great pleasure in presenting you the reward,
due, not only to your mental cultivation, but to the
goodness of your heart. What! do <span class='it'>you</span>, too, hesitate?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you be kind enough, sir,” said the generous
Kate, taking a paper from her pocket, “to read
Harriet’s story before you decide. I asked her for a
copy several days ago, and here it is.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You shall read it to the audience yourself, my
dear; I am sure they will listen patiently to so kind
a pleader in her friend’s behalf.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The listeners looked pleased and eager to hear the
story; and Kate Sumner, with a modest self-possession,
which well became her, and with her fine eyes
lighting up as she read, did full justice to the pretty
and touching story, of which Harriet had been so
cruelly robbed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It is well worth reading,” said Mr. Wentworth,
when she had finished; “your friend has won the
prize, my dear young lady; and, as she owes it to
your generosity, you shall have the pleasure of
bestowing it, yourself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kate’s face glowed with emotion as she hung the
chain around Harriet’s neck; and Harriet could not
restrain her tears, while she whispered,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I will take it, <span class='it'>not</span> as a prize, but as a gift from
<span class='it'>you</span>, dear Kate!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“And now, Miss Sumner,” said Mr. Wentworth,
in conclusion, “let me beg your acceptance of these
volumes, as a token of your teacher’s respect and
esteem,” and presenting her a beautifully bound edition
of Milton’s works, he bowed his adieu to the retiring
audience.</p>

<hr class='tbk110'/>

<p class='pindent'>“Will you lend me your prize-pencil this morning,
Harriet?” said Mrs. Carlton the next day. She was
dressed for a walk, and Harriet wondered why she
should want the pencil to take out with her; but she
immediately unclasped the chain from her neck, and
handed it to her mother without asking any questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She was rewarded at dinner by finding it lying
at the side of her plate, with the single word,
“Truth” engraved upon its seal.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY CHARLES J. PETERSON.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last days of November are at hand, and the
melancholy woods, shorn of their foliage, stand
skeleton-like against the cold, lowering sky; or toss
their branches to and fro, with a low moaning
sound, in the fitful tempest. Hark! how the gale
swells out with the deep voice of a cathedral organ,
or dies plaintively away like the cry of a lost child
in the forest. The sky is covered with cloud-rifts of
a deep, leaden color, only a spot of blue sky being
here and there visible; but occasionally the sun,
bursting, like a god, from the darkness that encircles
him, covers the brown hills with an effulgent
glory, while the opposite firmament is lit up with a
dull, fiery glow, that has something almost spectral
in its aspect. The streams are swollen and discolored,
and roll their turbid waters hoarsely onward.
Along the fields the brown grass whistles in
the wind, and the bare flower-stalks rattle, with a
melancholy tone, in the garden. Now and then,
drops of rain plash heavily to the ground. The
wind comes with a sudden chill to the nerves—the
bay is crisped into foam by the fitful gusts—and
along the bleak coast the now mountain waves roll
in with a hoarse, sullen roar, forewarning us of
shipwreck and death. Sad thoughts insensibly possess
the mind, and tales of sorrow, that had long
been forgot, come up to our memories. One such
is even now heavy on our heart—listen! and we
will rehearse it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was on just such a morning as this, many a long
year ago, and far away from our own happy land,
that a little congregation was gathered together in
the hills to worship God. The time was in those
sore and evil days when the decree of a tyrannical
king had gone forth, that no man should worship,
except as a corrupt hierarchy and lascivious court
might ordain—and when, all over Scotland, those
who would not give up the free birthright of their
fathers, were driven to meet in mountain glens, and
on lonely moors, whither their pastors—the holy
men who had baptized them in infancy, and united
them to the dear objects of their love—had already
been hunted. And often, in solitary places, where
hitherto only the cry of the eagle had been heard,
the Sabbath hymn rose sweetly up from tender
maidens and tearful wives, while their brothers and
husbands listened with weapons in their hands, or
watched from some neighboring eminence, lest the
fiery dragoons of Claverhouse should be in sight.
And when these God-defying troopers, with hands
red with the blood of the saints, burst into the little
flock, woful was the tale, and loud the wailing that
went through all the vales around. Every new Sabbath
brought its tale of slaughter, until the land
smoked with blood, and the incense thereof went
up from a hundred hills, crying for vengeance to the
Most High.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And such a congregation had now met in the hollow
of three hills, far away from the usual track of
the persecutors. A simple rock served the hoary
headed pastor for a pulpit; while hard by, a rivulet,
brawling over its pebbly bed, and then for a moment
expanding into a mimic lake, bottomed with silvery
sands, formed the holy font for baptism. Around
was gathered the little flock—aged sires and young
striplings, staid matrons and meek-eyed maidens,
young children and stalwart men—all gazing upward
into the pastor’s face, a sacred throng. But
there was one other there, who seemed equally with
him an object of anxious interest, and on whom
every eye was occasionally turned—a bright, beautiful
being, with far more of heaven than earth in
her deep, azure eyes. Oh! lovely was that fair-haired
girl, even as we may have dreamed a seraph
to be, all glorious with golden wings, under the
throne of God. And now there sat in those soft blue
eyes an expression of meek sorrow, tempered with
high and holy faith, for many and sore had been
the trials of Helen Græme; but grace had been
given her to endure them all, and even to rise above
them, with a courage which had made her dear unto
every heart among these wandering and persecuted
ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The father of Helen was the last son of a family
which had been decaying for centuries, and which,
of all its once mighty possessions, retained only the
comparatively small estate of Craigburnie, in one of
the southern counties of Scotland. To rebuild the
fortunes of his house had been the darling wish of
her father. For this purpose he had entered the
army of the Covenanters, during the wars of the
great revolution, and served with some distinction,
though without permanent advantage, in consequence
of the return of the king. On the happening
of this event, Mr. Græme retired to his estate,
soured and disappointed. Here he would have been
far more discontented than he was, but for his wife,
a lady of the meekest piety, and whose single minded
charity was known throughout all her native hills,
for Mrs. Græme was the daughter of one of the
holiest ministers of the kirk, and inherited not only
his piety, but the fervent admiration with which he
was regarded by his parishioners. She early instilled
into her child the pure precepts of our holy religion,
and often might the little girl be seen seated at her
mother’s knee, lisping the word of God, which the
parent taught her thus early to peruse. And, on the
Sabbath, who listened more attentively to the venerable
pastor, or joined with sweeter voice in the
anthem of praise? Nurtured thus, what wonder
that at seventeen she seemed the counterpart of the
mother, and was regarded by the poorer folk around
the Brae—her mother’s birthplace, and where she
spent several months each year—almost with veneration,
for had not many of them, in times of sore
trial, been sustained by the bounty, and cheered by
the smiles of the heavenly girl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>But at length her mother fell sick, and for many a
weary month Helen watched by the sufferer’s bed-side,
a ministering angel. During this illness she
noticed that, at times, her father would seem lost in
thought, as if something weighed heavily on his mind;
but Helen regarded it little, attributing it to his suspense
at her mother’s danger, for he loved both her
and his child with an intensity seemingly in contradiction
to his hard, unbending character, but which,
in truth, was the result of his total seclusion from the
world; for the sympathies thus shut out from others
lavished themselves wholly on his wife and daughter.
At length, Mrs. Græme died, and for many days it
seemed as if that strong man’s heart would break,
while Helen wept in silence, though not less uncontrollably.
Her father was now sterner than ever,
though not to her. He was more alone, often indulged
in fits of musing, and was absent at Edinburgh
for some days—an unusual occurrence—and
when he came back it was as Sir Roland Græme,
a title which men said he had purchased by selling
himself to the Court. Helen heard these rumors—which,
however, came to her ears in whispers, and
which at first she could not believe—with sorrow and
despair of heart; but no word of reproof broke from
her lips. Her sufferings were endured silently; but
so deep was her grief, that she pined away, seeming
to all eyes a being lent awhile to earth, and gradually
exhaling to heaven. Her father, thinking her
sorrow sprung wholly from her mother’s death, and
wishing, perhaps, that she should be from home
when he should first act for the government, sent
her to her mother’s native vale, alleging, and doubtless
hoping, that change of air would restore her to
health. It were doing him no more than justice to
say, that his paternal love was fully aroused to
Helen’s danger, and that he took the only possible
means to keep at his side this dear bud of her who
was now in heaven. He forgot how much the little
family at the Brae leaned toward the persecuted
sect—he forgot the disaffected character of the district
into which Helen went—he forgot the danger
lest her own feelings should become enlisted in behalf
of those against whom he was so soon to draw
his sword; remembering only—for was he not a
father?—that his child’s health was in danger, and
that a residence in the mountain district where she
had been born, and where she had spent so many
happy years, was the sole chance of saving her
life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And now Helen was once more amid the scenes
where her childhood had been spent, and every old
counsel and prayer of her mother, recalled to mind
by the spots where they had been first heard, rose
up before her, and softened her heart; and often, at
Sabbath eve, or in the still watches of the night, it
seemed to her as if the spirit of that sainted mother
hovered over her, whispering her heavenward, and
bidding her never to forget or forsake her God. All
the sympathies which now surrounded her, drew her
to the persecuted sect; for her cousin and aunt were
both among the non-conformists; and though the
little kirk, standing all alone in the hills, a cool well
in a parched desert, was now closed, and he who
had formerly ministered there an outcast, yet the
sight and recognition of him, at more than one stolen
meeting, recalled to Helen’s mind the time when he
blessed her, nestling bird-like to her mother’s bosom,
she looking the while half affrightedly, yet oh, how
reverentially, up into the face of the mild old man!
And was not her heart softened, even to tears, when
the patriarch, well remembering her—for none did
he ever forget—sought her among the crowd, and,
laying his hands on her head, blessed her, hoping
that God still kept her in the way her mother had
trod? From that hour Helen became a changed
being. The light heartedness of youth was gone.
She wept often, and prayed in solitary places by
herself; for lo! the struggle in her bosom, between
duty to her parent, and a higher duty to God, waxed
stronger and stronger; but daily she yearned more
and more to the oppressed remnant, until finally it
was whispered in the scattered congregation that the
persecutor’s daughter—that child of many prayers—was
to become a professed member of the flock.
And old men and nursing mothers in the church
blessed God as they heard it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this Sabbath morning, Helen had, for the first
time, openly attended a meeting in the hills. At
first, she had come with fear and trembling, but
when she saw the looks of kindly sympathy with
which all regarded her, she became more composed,
and could enter on the holy duties of the day in a
fitting mood. And when the aged pastor gave out
the hymn, and the congregation joined in the sacred
anthem, what voice sang of redeeming love so
sweetly as that of Helen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Lo! the vision of light has passed from our souls,
and in place of that seraphic countenance, we behold
the face of a stern warrior, in every feature of
which we read of cruelty and blood. Even now he
is hot in pursuit of the suffering remnant, and with
his troop of fiery dragoons interrupts the Sabbath
quiet of the vales and glens, with the jingling of
broad swords and the ribald jests of scoffers; and
many a dark-browed peasant scowls on the persecutor
as he passes, and prays that God will yet avenge
his slaughtered saints. Nor, if the popular rumor is
to be believed, is that vengeance altogether withheld;
for men say that Sir Roland Græme, having
sold his religion for the paltry honors of earth, has
been already cursed from on high, and that, sleeping
or waking, he finds no rest from the stingings of
remorse; yet, like one who has committed the unpardonable
sin, he cannot draw back from his career
of blood, but is impelled onward, as if by some irresistible
power, to still darker crimes. Look upon
his face again, and tell us if there is not something
there which you shudder to behold—something of
untold horror in that stern, God-defying brow, as if
the arch-enemy had already been suffered to affix his
seal upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And whither was that man of blood going? Far,
far over hill and dale, to the slaughter of the saints.
He had heard, through some traitor, of the assemblage
to be held that morning in the hills, and with
the first dawn of day he and his troopers had been in
the saddle, thirsting to participate in the bloody sacrament.
For the last half hour he had seemed lost in
thought, and now he suddenly drew in his rein, and
turned to his lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Lennox,” he said, “I believe I will not lead
these brave fellows to-day, but surrender the command
to you. I see, over yonder hill, the blue summit
that looks down on the Brae, where my daughter
is visiting. I have not seen her for months, nor is it
probable I shall be in this district for many months
more. The country here is widely disaffected, and
therefore an unbecoming residence for a child of
mine. It has just struck me that I might cross the
hills, and bring her home with me this afternoon.
And yet something whispers to me that I ought
rather to pursue these traitors and schismatics,” he
continued, as if to himself; “however, I can trust
to you, and it is imperative that my daughter leave
this district. We will meet here by four o’clock.
Your road lies down yonder glen. All I have to say
is, ‘spare none!’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I understand,” said the subordinate; “neither
age nor sex.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Neither age nor sex, nor even those of rank, if
such there be,” sternly said Sir Roland; “when the
poison has sunk deep, nothing but the cautery will
cure. And hark ye! on the faithful execution of
your commands depends your hope of preferment.
I would not spare my own child, if I found her
among these spawn of Satan!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, with these memorable words, he ordered a
detachment of his company to follow him, and rode
off, though at first reluctantly, in the direction of the
Brae.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The route was passed in silence, for Sir Roland
was buried in thought. There was indeed cause for
it. One or two things in the last letter he had received
from his daughter—and that missive had now
been written a month—made him feel uneasy, lest
she looked more favorably on the persecuted sect
than became a daughter of his; and it was this fear,
all at once recalled to mind by the business on
which he had set forth this morning, that determined
him so suddenly to leave the dispersion of the conventicle
to his lieutenant, while he should ride over
to the Brae, and bring his daughter home. Other
thoughts, too, were busy within him. The long
coveted rank had brought little alleviation to his
soured and disappointed mind, for his fortune was
now more than ever inadequate to his condition,
and all the peculiarly sensitive feelings of a proud
man were stung to the quick by the indignities to
which, in consequence, he was often exposed.
Moreover, he was aware of the light in which he
was held, since his change of politics, not only by
the common people, but by large portions of the
gentry; so that, on every hand, he was soured and
irritated, and longed to wreak on the Covenanters
the hate which he felt toward all men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And yet, as he approached the Brae, and saw at a
distance the low roof of the mansion from which he
had taken his bride, gentler feelings stole into his
bosom. He thought of her whom he had once loved
with all the fervor of a first passion—he remembered
the happy years they had spent together—and when
he recollected that she was now no more, and that
the last time he had beheld these roofs he had been in
her company, a tear almost gathered into his eye.
Then he thought of his daughter. As her image rose
up before him, his heart was fully melted. With all
the sternness of his character he loved that daughter
as few fathers loved—ay! loved her doubly since
her mother’s death, for she was now the only object
in the whole wide world on which he could bestow
aught of affection. And now, joy at the prospect of
meeting her gave to his spirits the glad exhilaration
of boyhood, and quickening his pace, he galloped
gaily across the hills, nor drew his rein until he
reached the door of the old mansion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Brae was an antique and partially dilapidated
residence, at present inhabited by the aunt of Helen,
and a daughter about the age of Miss Græme. At
all times it wore a sombre, deserted look, but on this
morning it seemed peculiarly desolate, for the whole
front of the house was closed, and all the outhouses
shut up. A strange fear came over the father, as he
beheld the absence of these signs of life, and he
hastily ordered one of the dragoons to dismount and
knock at the door. The man obeyed, but for a time
knocked in vain. The sound of the hilt of his heavy
sword, striking on the door, echoed through the long
hall of the house; but no signs of life within were
visible. The usual frown on the face of Sir Roland
grew darker, and he cried angrily—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blow off the lock with a pistol, and search the
house!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this instant, however, and just as the trooper
was proceeding to execute this order, the face of an
old woman was protruded from one of the upper
windows, while she demanded who was below.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Sir Roland Græme,” replied the leader; “where
are the family? where is Miss Græme? Is any one
sick?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They are all well, but out!” briefly said the
woman.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Out—out!” exclaimed the persecutor, “and on
Sunday, when there is no church within miles. By
G—,” he continued, striving to drown his fears in
rage, “is this a time to be out? Where have they
gone? Answer truly, on your life!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“May it please your honor,” said one of the
dragoons, touching his cap, “may they not have
gone to this conventicle, and taken your daughter
with them?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quick as lightning, Sir Roland wheeled round on
the unthinking speaker, and while the indentation
on his brow became deeper than ever, and his
eye flashed with rage, he said—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“<span class='it'>My</span> daughter consorting with traitors and schismatics!
Breathe but the word again, and by the
God of heaven I will cleave you to the chine!”
and his fingers played nervously with the hilt of his
sword; but, seeing the deprecating look of the
trooper, he recovered himself, and added, “tush!
man, you are innocent, but take care how even innocently
you rouse the tiger.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tiger,” shrieked the old woman, who had known
Sir Roland in former days, and who now seemed impelled
by some sudden gust of passion to speak out,
“it is well said; ay! one whose fangs have been in
the hearts of the persecuted remnant—but God will
avenge his people. Know, false persecutor, that
your daughter <span class='it'>has</span> gone forth to-day to become one
of the chosen few against whom, oh! man of sin,
you have so often ridden with steel and war horse,
holding the commission of your master, the Evil
One. Go to, Roland Græme, I mind ye when ye
were a boy, and little did I think ye would ever become
the Judas you are now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is probable that if her hearer had comprehended
the whole of this harangue, a bullet would have been
the speaker’s reward; but the first words of the old
woman, when taken in connection with the desertion
of the house, and his own misgivings from Helen’s
late letter, assured him that his daughter had indeed
attended the conventicle. The conviction fell on his
heart with agonizing force. Remembering the injunctions
of indiscriminate butchery he had laid on
his subordinate, and well knowing that the command
would be fulfilled to the very letter, he staggered
back in his saddle, with a face whiter than ashes,
and was fain to grasp the pommel for support, while
he exclaimed in tones wrung from him by the keenest
anguish—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My child!—my child!—I have murdered my
child!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“What is that ye say?” screamed the old hag,
leaning eagerly forward; “have ye sent out your
reiving dragoons against the Lord’s anointed? and
ye fear that they will slay your ain bairn. Oh! man
of blood, the judgment of God has come upon ye—the
judgment has come upon ye!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>But to the voice of the speaker, as well as to the
astonished looks of the dragoons, the father was insensible.
He still remained clutching the saddle,
every feature of his face working with intense
agony, and his eyes glaring vacantly on the air.
Those who looked on him shrunk back aghast at
the horror of his aspect; which, fearful as it was,
only faintly shadowed forth the torture of the soul
within. The peril of his only child stupefied him for
a time. Then a succession of wild images rose up
to his mind. He saw his daughter flying before the
ruthless dragoons—he heard her cries for mercy, and
the bitter sneer of disbelief on the part of her pursuers—he
beheld her lying a corpse on the bare
heath, her bosom gashed with brutal wounds, and
her long fair hair dabbled with blood. In that moment
the memory of every one whom he had slain
came up before him—the mothers who had clung to
his knees, the babes who had looked innocently in
his face as they died, the daughters whose aged
parents he had slain before their eyes. He thought
of the silvery headed patriarch whom he had shot
for refusing the test, and the prophetic warning of
the victim that he, even he, the proud persecutor,
should curse the day he ever drew his sword against
the saints, came up to his memory. He groaned in
anguish. For a time none dared to intrude on his
misery. One of his men, a trusty body adherent, at
length ventured to speak, by asking him if they had
not better ride with all haste after Lennox, in the
hope that they might yet come up in time. Starting,
as if a shot had struck him, the father plunged his
rowels into the side of his steed, until the blood
gushed forth, and wheeling his horse sharp around,
looked back sternly on his followers, as he led the
way at a fearful pace up the hill. Well did he
know the country around, and necessary, indeed,
was that knowledge, for his frantic gallop required
the most intimate acquaintance with every turn and
inequality of the road. Over hill and dale, through
glen and moor he dashed, reckless of danger, for
how could he think of aught but his daughter? Oh!
what would he not have given to be assured that he
should once more look into her soft blue eyes, that
he should again press her to his bosom. What now
to him was rank or wealth? Perhaps he thought
that Helen would be able to reveal her name ere she
fell a victim—but no! for even if she spoke, would
his subordinate believe her story? Once, the very
suspicion that she favored the Covenanters had angered
him, but now he would forgive every thing,
only to be assured of her safety. The contending
emotions—hope and fear, love and anger, suspense
and despair—that agitated his bosom, made that
hour’s ride an hour of agony, such as he had never
before thought a human being could endure, and
live. He felt that the curse of God was on him—that
all the agonies he had inflicted on others were
now concentrated on himself—that he was bound to
the wheel of fire. His punishment had already begun.
He had rushed against the thick bosses of the Almighty’s
buckler, and found, like him of old, that
man could not contend against the Most High.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We remember, when a boy, waking from a dream
of horror, to find our mother smiling over our sleep.
Oh! never shall we forget the heavenly radiance of
that loved face, for radiant with heaven it seemed to
us, after the terrors of that midnight vision. Even
so we feel when turning from contemplating the tortures
of the persecutor, to gaze on his sainted child.
The hour was now approaching noon, and Helen, in
the presence of the silent flock, had taken upon her
those vows she could never put off. Tears fell from
many an eye as the worshipers beheld her thus in
their midst; and the old pastor was so affected that
he could scarcely speak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“God will reward you, my daughter, and give you
strength,” he said; “I bless His holy name that thou
art delivered from the dominion of Baal. It is hard,
I know, to disobey a parent; but saith not the Scripture,
that we must leave father and mother, if required,
and take up our cross and follow Christ?
Only persevere, and God will make your way plain
to you, guiding you, even as he led the children of
Israel, with a pillar of cloud by day, and of fire by
night. Trials, and sore ones, we must all have in
this world—and I boast not, but only speak to cheer
you, when I say that mine have been many and hard,
but God has given me grace to endure all, even as
He will give it unto you. But my race is nearly run;
the golden urn will soon be broken at the fountain.
I only pray to die like the martyrs of old, with my
armor on, and my sword girt to my thigh. Come,
oh! Lord, most mighty,” he continued, raising his
hands and eyes rapturously above, “come, oh! Lord
most gracious, and come quickly!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A deep silence followed the conclusion of this
prayer, while the tears of many fell fast and thick.
Every eye was fixed on the holy man, or turned to
Helen, for the countenances of both already seemed
to glow, as those of angels. None dared to draw a
breath, lest they should dispel the hushed stillness
that so well accorded with the solemnity of the moment.
But suddenly a cry was heard, clear, loud
and startling—“The dragoons—the dragoons are
here!” and had a voice come from the dead, it
would not have produced a more sudden change in
the hearers. Every one started up, and all eyes
were turned toward the point whence the cry had
proceeded. There, on a gentle eminence, stood a
shepherd waving his plaid, and making gestures for
the congregation to fly up the glen. In an instant all
was confusion. Mothers clasped their infants to
their bosoms, and looked up tremblingly, with faces
whiter than ashes—maidens clung to their lovers,
and gazed around with dilated eyes and looks of
terror—and fathers and brothers, gathering around
these dear ones, hurried them on foot and horseback,
in the direction indicated by the sentinel. The escort
of Helen and her aunt had been several armed retainers,
and these now rallied to the side of their
mistress and the pastor, prepared to make good their
retreat, or defend themselves to the last. Hoping to
escape the notice of the pursuers, they dashed off in
a different direction from that pursued by the others
of the congregation; but just as they turned the angle
of the hill, the pennons of the troopers came into
sight, and by the immediate diversion of a party in
pursuit of them, the fugitives knew they were detected.
Pricking their horses, they now hurried
rapidly onward, and for several hundred yards lost
sight of their pursuers. At length, the little party
reached the brow of a slight acclivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Faster—faster,” said one who had looked back,
“they gain on us—press on.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every eye was turned in the direction of the pursuers,
and there, not half the distance they had been
before, were the dragoons, thundering along with
fiery haste. The sight gave new energy to the fugitives,
who urged on their steeds with redoubled vigor.
For a while now the result seemed doubtful. During
this interval of suspense the feelings of the fugitives
were of the most conflicting character—the instinctive
love of life alternating with a holy resignation
to whatever fate might be assigned them. Now, as
they gained on the troopers, the former prevailed,
and now, as they saw their pursuers drawing nigher,
the latter won the mastery. The emotions of each,
meanwhile, were different. The old pastor, with
eyes uplifted, seemed rapturously awaiting martyrdom—the
aunt and cousin of Helen were pale and red
by turns as their fear or faith rose triumphant, while
the serving men frowned darkly as they looked behind,
and appeared to wish for a chance to exchange
passes with their steel-clad oppressors. But the feelings
of Helen were most difficult to analyze, though
perhaps they had less of earth in them than those of
any except the pastor. Subdued by the day’s sacrifice
of herself, and all glowing with divine faith and
energy, what had she to fear from death? Yet, even
with this perfect resignation, she could not avoid
looking back on their pursuers, while her heart heat
quicker as the distance increased between the troopers
and themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We gain—we gain—press on, we shall escape,”
shouted the leader of the little party, “the Lord will
yet deliver us from our enemies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Nay, nay,” said the pastor suddenly, “the hour
has come—see ye not that we are cut off in front, lo!
the horses and the men-of-war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>A cry—almost a shriek—broke from Helen’s two
female companions as they looked ahead, and saw,
emerging from a narrow ravine, another party of
dragoons, led by a tall, dark man far in advance of
the rest, and all riding with tumultuous haste. Helen
spoke not, but only raised her eyes to heaven, for
escape was now impossible. The ravine ahead was
the only feasible outlet in that direction, from the
glen up which the fugitives had fled, and to turn back
would be to fall on the swords of their pursuers.
The serving men looked aghast, and drew in their
reins, which example the rest of the party immediately
followed. For a minute there was a profound
silence. At length the leader again spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why stand we here? Escape is impossible, unless
we can cut our way through. Let us charge the
party behind, for that is the smaller. Form a circle
around the women—wheel—trot.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no time for consultation, and the proposal
seemed to point out the only feasible plan.
With the words they wheeled their horses, and dashed
to the desperate attack. The dragoons seemed
for an instant astonished by the movement, but did
not slacken their pace. Their leader waved his
sword, and turning to his men, led the onset in person,
shouting “God save the king and bishops,”
while the Covenanters, unsheathing their blades,
raised the cry of “The sword of the Lord and Gideon.”
And thus, borne in the midst of those armed
men as in the embrace of a whirlwind, Helen
was hurried toward the dragoons. And as they galloped
along, the heavenly girl, with heart uplifted,
prayed, while her countenance shone with a glory
as of the cherubim.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And who was it that dashed so frantically up the
glen, as if fearful that he might not arrive to whet
his blade in the blood of the fugitives? Who, but
Sir Roland Græme, flying to save his daughter, and
even now almost maddened with the thought that he
had come too late, for the instant that he emerged
from the ravine he recognized his child, and now,
when he saw her turned back to the pursuers, and
his practiced eye told him that he could not reach her
until the two parties should be engaged in deadly
combat, the same sickening sensation of horror
which had attacked him at the Brae came over him
again. With a sharp cry of agony he ploughed his
spurs into the already bloody sides of his horse, and
sprang forward at a pace even more frantic than that
which he had before led; but swift as was his progress
it seemed to him only that of a snail. On—on—he
urged his gallant beast, and nearer and nearer
the fugitives and their first pursuers drew to each
other. What though he gained on the group!—he
saw that the hostile parties would meet while he
would yet be far away. Oh! what were his feelings as
this conviction forced itself on him. If only another
mile, in which to overtake them, had been given
him, he might perhaps have succeeded; but now
hope was in vain! Cold drops of sweat stood on his
brow, while his heart throbbed almost to bursting
against his corselet. Did none recognize him, and
could they not understand his frantic signs? He
shouted—again—again—again. The dead might as
well be expected to hear. He waved his plumed hat
on high, but, at that instant, with the shock of an
earthquake, the opponents met. A dizziness came
over his eyes, but with a mighty effort he rallied his
reeling faculties, and looked at the fight. Was his
child yet alive? He saw the gleam of the broadswords,
the blaze of firearms, and all the tumult of
the conflict, but his daughter was not visible. Suddenly
a sharp, quick, female shriek, rising shrill over
the uproar, met his ear. God of heaven, had his
Helen fallen! Another leap of his frantic steed, and
he was near enough to hear the shouts of the combatants
and distinguish particular persons. He trembled
with eagerness, but lo! his daughter was still
unharmed, girt around as with a wall of steel, by
the broadswords of her defenders. He rose in his
stirrups at the sight, and waving his hat around his
head, shouted with the voice of a Titan. Joy—joy!
they recognize him, and his child extends her arms
toward him. She is saved. But no! for at this very
instant, when at length they understood by their leader’s
gestures that they were to desist, one of the
dragoons, availing himself of the confusion of the
moment and thirsting for vengeance for a wound he
had received, aimed a pistol at the pastor’s bosom,
and though a fellow soldier struck aside his arm, it
was only to wing the deadly ball to another heart,
even that of Helen, who all along had been nestled
by the side of the holy man. She fell back into his
arms, the blood gushing from her bosom, and for an
instant they thought her gone. But when the pastor
called on her name she faintly opened her eyes,
pressed his hand, smiled sweetly, and murmuring of
heaven, sank away apparently into a slumber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One wild cry of horror had risen, at her fall, from
those immediately around her, telling the tale of her
murder; but the father needed not this confirmation
of his worst fears, for he had seen the shot and beheld
her fall. Galloping wildly forward, with a few gigantic
leaps he reached the offender, whom he smote
to the earth with a single blow of his broadsword.
The next instant he was by his daughter’s side, the
group opening awe-struck to let him pass. He spoke
not, but oh! the terrible agony of his countenance.
Putting them aside with arms extended, he approached
and gazed down into the face of his child—gazed as
Sapphira did when the apostle told her doom, and she
saw the bearers returning from her husband’s burial.
And for a minute of profound silence he continued
gazing thus, into that fair sweet face, on which,
though now stilled as in death, there yet lingered a
smile of heavenly joy. He shuddered as he looked,
and his countenance became livid as that of a corpse.
He essayed to speak, but though his lips moved, no
sound proceeded from them. At length slowly, almost
reluctantly, he stooped down and took her
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Helen—Helen,” he said, in a choking voice,
“you are not dead. Say so—tell me I am not your
murderer. Oh! speak, and forgive me.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dying girl faintly opened her eyes, and gazed
vacantly into her father’s face. Her senses were
fast deserting her. She did not recognize him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh God! my child is dying,” groaned the father.
“Helen, Helen,” he continued, raising his voice,
“do you not know me? I am your father—your
murderer. Do not look on me with such strange
eyes! Helen, Helen dear, say, if only by a smile,
that you forgive me. Oh! Lord God of heaven,”
he exclaimed, lifting his eyes agonizingly above,
“have mercy on me—suffer her to live to forgive
me—crush not the bruised reed,” and hot tears
gushed from his eyes and trickled in his daughter’s
face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Who weeps?” faintly said the dying sufferer,
“weep not for me. Tell my father how I love him,
and die blessing him⁠—”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Thank thee, Almighty Father, I thank thee,”
gasped the penitent. “Helen, here is your father—I
am he.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the first time, now, the dying girl seemed fully
to comprehend her situation. She looked a minute
around the group, and then, with a sweet smile, her
eyes rested on her father’s face. She faintly pressed
his hand. Tears gushed from his eyes like rain, and
though he strove to speak he could not for his sobs.
She murmured of him, of her mother, of heaven, and
then they knew she was dead. The father looked on
her a moment, and with a groan—which none there
ever forgot—sunk helpless to her side. They raised
him, but he was a corpse. “Vengeance is mine,”
saith the Lord, “and I will repay.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hardly any event creates a stronger sensation in
a thinly settled New England village, especially
among the young folks, than the arrival of a fresh
and blooming miss, who comes to make her abode
in the neighborhood. When, therefore, Squire Johnson,
the only lawyer in the place, and a very respectable
man of course, told Farmer Jones one afternoon
that his wife’s sister, a smart girl of eighteen,
was coming in a few days to reside in his family,
the news flew like wildfire through Pond village, and
was the principal topic of conversation for a week.
Pond village is situated upon the margin of one of
those numerous and beautiful sheets of water that
gem the whole surface of New England, like the
bright stars in an evening sky, and received its appellation
to distinguish it from two or three other
villages in the same town, which could not boast of
a similar location. When Farmer Jones came in to
his supper about sunset that afternoon, and took his
seat at the table, the eyes of the whole family were
upon him, for there was a peculiar working about
his mouth and a knowing glance of his eye, that
always told them when he had something of interest
to communicate. But Farmer Jones’ secretiveness
was large, and his temperament not the most active,
and he would probably have rolled the important
secret as a sweet morsel under his tongue for a
long time, had not Mrs. Jones, who was of rather an
impatient and prying turn of mind, contrived to draw
it from him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, Mr. Jones,” said she, as she handed him
his cup of tea, “what is it you are going to say? Do
out with it; for you’ve been chawing something or
other over in your mind ever since you came into
the house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“It’s my tobacher, I s’pose,” said Mr. Jones, with
another knowing glance of his eye.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, father, what is the use?” said Susan; “we
all know you’ve got something or other you want to
say, and why can’t you tell us what ’tis?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La, who cares what ’tis?” said Mrs. Jones; “if
it was any thing worth telling, we shouldn’t have to
wait for it, I dare say.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hereupon Mrs. Jones assumed an air of the most
perfect indifference, as the surest way of conquering
what she was pleased to call Mr. Jones’ obstinacy,
which by the way was a very improper term to apply
in the case; for it was purely the working of
secretiveness without the least particle of obstinacy
attached to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was a pause for two or three minutes in the
conversation, till Mr. Jones passed his cup to be filled
a second time, when with a couple of preparatory
hems he began to let out the secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We are to have a new neighbor here in a few
days,” said Mr. Jones, stopping short when he had
uttered thus much, and sipping his tea and filling his
mouth with food.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mrs. Jones, who was perfect in her tactics, said
not a word, but attended to the affairs of the table, as
though she had not noticed what was said. The
farmer’s secretiveness had at last worked itself out,
and he began again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Squire Johnson’s wife’s sister is coming here in
a few days, and is going to live with ’em.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The news being thus fairly divulged, it left free
scope for conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I wonder if she is a proud, stuck up
piece,” said Mrs. Jones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I shouldn’t think she would be,” said Susan,
“for there aint a more sociabler woman in the
neighborhood than Miss Johnson. So if she’s at all
like her sister I think we shall like her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder how old she is,” said Stephen, who was
just verging toward the close of his twenty-first year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“The squire called her eighteen,” said Mr. Jones,
giving a wink to his wife, as much as to say, that’s
about the right age for Stephen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I wonder if she is handsome,” said Susan, who
was somewhat vain of her own looks, and having
been a sort of reigning belle in Pond village for some
time, felt a little alarm at the idea of a rival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I dare be bound she’s handsome,” said Mrs.
Jones, “if she’s sister to Miss Johnson; for where’ll
you find a handsomer woman than Miss Johnson, go
the town through?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>After supper, Stephen went down to Mr. Robinson’s
store, and told the news to young Charles
Robinson and all the young fellows who were
gathered there for a game at quoits and a ring at
wrestling. And Susan went directly over to Mr.
Bean’s and told Patty, and Patty went round to the
Widow Davis’ and told Sally, and before nine o’clock
the matter was pretty well understood in about every
house in the village.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the close of the fourth day, a little before sunset,
a chaise was seen to drive up to Squire Johnson’s
door. Of course the eyes of the whole village
were turned in that direction. Sally Davis, who was
just coming in from milking, set her pail down on
the grass by the side of the road as soon as the chaise
came in sight, and watched it till it reached the
squire’s door, and the gentleman and lady had got
out and gone into the house. Patty Bean was doing
up the ironing that afternoon, and she had just taken
a hot iron from the fire as the chaise passed the door,
and she ran with it in her hand and stood on the door
steps till the whole ceremony of alighting, greeting,
and entering the house, was over. Old Mrs. Bean
stood with her head out of the window, her iron-bowed
spectacles resting upon the top of her forehead,
her shriveled hand placed across her eyebrows
to defend her red eyes from the rays of the setting
sun, and her skinny chin protruding about three
inches in advance of a couple of stubs of teeth, which
her open mouth exposed fairly to view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Seems to me they are dreadful loving,” said old
Mrs. Bean, as she saw Mrs. Johnson descend the
steps and welcome her sister with a kiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“La me, if there isn’t the squire kissing of her
tu,” said Patty; “well, I declare, I would a waited
till I got into the house, I’ll die if I wouldn’t. It
looks so vulgar to be kissing afore folks, and out
doors tu; I should think Squire Johnson would be
ashamed of himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well, I shouldn’t,” said young John Bean, who
came up at that moment, and who had passed the
chaise just as the young lady alighted from it. “I
shouldn’t be ashamed to kiss sich a pretty gal as that
any how; I’d kiss her wherever I could ketch her,
if it was in the meetin-house.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why, is she handsome, Jack?” said Patty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Yes, she’s got the prettiest little puckery kind of
a mouth I’ve seen this six months. Her cheeks are
red, and her eyes shine like new buttons.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Well,” replied Patty, “if she’ll only take the
shine off of Susan Jones when she goes to meetin,
Sunday, I sha’n’t care.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>While these observations were going on at old Mr.
Bean’s, Charles Robinson and a group of young fellows
with him were standing in front of Robinson’s
store, a little farther down the road, and watching
the scene that was passing at Squire Johnson’s.
They witnessed the whole with becoming decorum,
now and then making a remark about the fine horse
and the handsome chaise, till they saw the tall squire
bend his head down and give the young lady a kiss,
when they all burst out into a loud laugh. In a moment,
being conscious that their laugh must be heard
and noticed at the squire’s, they, in order to do away
the impression it must necessarily make, at once
turned their heads the other way, and Charles Robinson,
who was quick at an expedient, knocked off the
hat of the lad who was standing next to him, and
then they all laughed louder than before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Here comes Jack Bean,” said Charles, “now we
shall hear something about her, for Jack was coming
by the squire’s when she got out of the chaise. How
does she look, Jack?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Handsome as a picter,” said Jack. “I haint
seen a prettier gal since last Thanksgiving Day,
when Jane Ford was here to visit Susan Jones.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Black eyes or blue?” said Charles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Blue,” said Jack, “but all-fired bright.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Tall or short?” said Stephen Jones, who was
rather short himself, and therefore felt a particular
interest on that point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Rather short,” said Jack, “but straight and round
as our young colt.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Do you know what her name is?” said Charles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“They called her Lucy when she got out of the
chaise,” said Jack, “and as Miss Johnson’s name
was Brown before she was married, I s’pose her
name must be Lucy Brown.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Just such a name as I like,” said Charles Robinson;
“Lucy Brown sounds well. Now suppose, in
order to get acquainted with her, we all hands take a
sail to-morrow night, about this time, on the pond,
and invite her to go with us.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Agreed,” said Stephen Jones. “Agreed,” said
Jack Bean. “Agreed,” said all hands.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question then arose, who should carry the invitation
to her; and the young men being rather
bashful on that score, it was finally settled that
Susan Jones should bear the invitation, and accompany
her to the boat, where they should all be in
waiting to receive her. The next day was a very
long day, at least to most of the young men of Pond
village; and promptly, an hour before sunset, most
of them were assembled, with half a score of their
sisters and female cousins, by a little stone wharf on
the margin of the pond, for the proposed sail. All
the girls in the village, of a suitable age, were there,
except Patty Bean. She had undergone a good deal
of fidgeting and fussing during the day, to prepare for
the sail, but had been disappointed. Her new bonnet
was not done; and as for wearing her old flap-sided
bonnet, she declared she would not, if she
never went. Presently Susan Jones and Miss Lucy
Brown were seen coming down the road. In a moment
all were quiet, the laugh and the joke were
hushed, and each one put on his best looks. When
they arrived, Susan went through the ceremony of
introducing Miss Brown to each of the ladies and
gentlemen present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“But how in the world are you going to sail?”
said Miss Brown, “for there isn’t a breath of wind;
and I don’t see any sail-boat, neither.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh, the less wind we have, the better, when we
sail here,” said Charles Robinson; “and there is
our sail-boat,” pointing to a flat-bottomed scow-boat,
some twenty feet long by ten wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We don’t use no sails,” said Jack Bean; “sometimes,
when the wind is fair, we put up a bush to
help pull along a little, and when ’tisn’t, we row.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The party were soon embarked on board the scow,
and a couple of oars were set in motion, and they
glided slowly and pleasantly over as lovely a sheet
of water as ever glowed in the sunsetting ray. In
one hour’s time, the whole party felt perfectly acquainted
with Miss Lucy Brown. She had talked in
the most lively and fascinating manner; she had told
stories and sung songs. Among others, she had
given Moore’s boat song, with the sweetest possible
effect; and by the time they returned to the landing,
it would hardly be too much to say that half the
young men in the party were decidedly in love with
her.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A stern regard to truth requires a remark to be
made here, not altogether favorable to Susan Jones,
which is the more to be regretted, as she was in the
main an excellent hearted girl, and highly esteemed
by the whole village. It was observed that as the
company grew more and more pleased with Miss
Lucy Brown, Susan Jones was less and less animated,
till at last she became quite reserved, and
apparently sad. She, however, on landing, treated
Miss Brown with respectful attention, accompanied
her home to Squire Johnson’s door, and cordially
bade her good night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The casual glimpses which the young men of
Pond village had of Miss Brown during the remainder
of the week, as she occasionally stood at
the door, or looked out at the window, or once or
twice when she walked out with Susan Jones, and
the fair view they all had of her at meeting on the
Sabbath, served but to increase their admiration,
and to render her more and more an object of attraction.
She was regarded by all as a prize, and several
of them were already planning what steps it was
best to take in order to win her. The two most prominent
candidates, however, for Miss Brown’s favor,
were Charles Robinson and Stephen Jones. Their
position and standing among the young men of the
village seemed to put all others in the back ground.
Charles, whose father was wealthy, had every advantage
which money could procure. But Stephen,
though poor, had decidedly the advantage over
Charles in personal recommendations. He had
more talent, was more sprightly and intelligent,
and more pleasing in his address. From the evening
of the sail on the pond, they had both watched
every movement of Miss Brown with the most intense
interest; and, as nothing can deceive a lover,
each had, with an interest no less intense, watched
every movement of the other. They had ceased to
speak to each other about her, and if her name was
mentioned in their presence, both were always observed
to color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second week after her arrival, through the
influence of Squire Johnson, the district school was
offered to Miss Brown on the other side of the pond,
which offer was accepted, and she went immediately
to take charge of it. This announcement at first
threw something of a damper upon the spirits of the
young people of Pond village. But when it was understood
the school would continue but a few weeks,
and being but a mile and a half distant, Miss Brown
would come home every Saturday afternoon, and
spend the Sabbath, it was not very difficult to be reconciled
to the temporary arrangement. The week
wore away heavily, especially to Charles Robinson
and Stephen Jones. They counted the days impatiently
till Saturday, and on Saturday they counted
the long and lagging hours till noon. They had both
made up their minds that it would be dangerous to
wait longer, and they had both resolved not to let
another Sabbath pass without making direct proposals
to Miss Brown.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Stephen Jones was too early a riser for Charles
Robinson, and, in any enterprise where both were
concerned, was pretty sure to take the lead, except
where money could carry the palm, and then, of
course, it was always borne away by Charles. As
Miss Lucy had been absent most of the week, and
was to be at home that afternoon, Charles Robinson
had made an arrangement with his mother and sisters
to have a little tea party in the evening, for the purpose
of inviting Miss Brown; and then, of course,
he should walk home with her in the evening; and
then, of course, would be a good opportunity to
break the ice, and make known to her his feelings
and wishes. Stephen Jones, however, was more
prompt in his movements. He had got wind of the
proposed tea party, although himself and sister, for
obvious reasons, had not been invited, and he resolved
not to risk the arrival of Miss Brown and her
visit to Mr. Robinson’s, before he should see her.
She would dismiss her school at noon, and come the
distance of a mile and a half round the pond home.
His mind was at once made up. He would go round
and meet her at the school-house, and accompany
her on her walk. There, in that winding road
around those delightful waters, with the tall and
shady trees over head, and the wild grape-vines
twining round their trunks, and climbing to the
branches, while the wild birds were singing through
the woods, and the wild ducks playing in the coves
along the shore, surely there, if any where in the
world, could a man bring his mind up to the point
of speaking of love.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, a little before noon, Stephen washed
and brushed himself up, and put on his Sunday
clothes, and started on his expedition. In order to
avoid observation, he took a back route across the
field, intending to come into the road by the pond, a
little out of the village. As ill luck would have it,
Charles Robinson had been out in the same direction,
and was returning with an armful of green
boughs and wild flowers, to ornament the parlor for
the evening. He saw Stephen, and noticed his
dress, and the direction he was going, and he at
once smoked the whole business. His first impulse
was to rush upon him and collar him, and demand
that he should return back. But then he recollected
that in the last scratch he had with Stephen, two or
three years before, he had a little the worst of it,
and he instinctively stood still while Stephen passed
on without seeing him. It flashed upon his mind at
once that the question must now be reduced to a
game of speed. If he could by any means gain the
school-house first, and engage Miss Lucy to walk
home with him, he should consider himself safe.
But if Stephen should reach the school-house first,
he should feel a good deal of uneasiness for the consequences.
Stephen was walking very leisurely,
and unconscious that he was in any danger of a
competitor on the course, and it was important that
his suspicions should not be awakened. Charles,
therefore, remained perfectly quiet till Stephen had
got a little out of hearing, and then he threw down
his bushes and flowers, and ran to the wharf below
the store with his utmost speed. He had one advantage
over Stephen. He was ready at a moment’s
warning to start on an expedition of this kind, for
Sunday clothes were an every-day affair with him.
There was a light canoe, belonging to his father,
lying at the wharf, and a couple of stout boys were
there fishing. Charles hailed them, and told them if
they would row him across the pond as quick as
they possibly could, he would give them a quarter of
a dollar a piece. This, in their view, was a splendid
offer for their services, and they jumped on board
with alacrity and manned the oars. Charles took a
paddle, and stood in the stern to steer the boat, and
help propel her ahead. The distance by water was
a little less than by land, and although Stephen had
considerably the start of him, he believed he should
be able to reach the school-house first, especially if
Stephen should not see him and quicken his pace.
In one minute after he arrived at the wharf, the boat
was under full way. The boys laid down to the oars
with right good will, and Charles put out all his
strength upon the paddle. They were shooting over
the water twice as fast as a man could walk, and
Charles already felt sure of the victory. But when
they had gone about half a mile, they came in the
range of a little opening in the trees on the shore,
where the road was exposed to view, and there, at
that critical moment, was Stephen pursuing his easy
walk. Charles’ heart was in his mouth. Still it was
possible Stephen might not see them, for he had not
yet looked round. Lest the sound of the oars might
attract his attention, Charles had instantly, on coming
in sight, ordered the boys to stop rowing, and he
grasped his paddle with breathless anxiety, and
waited for Stephen again to disappear. But just as
he was upon the point of passing behind some trees,
where the boat would be out of his sight, Stephen
turned his head and looked round. He stopped short,
turned square round, and stood for the space of a
minute looking steadily at the boat. Then lifting his
hand, and shaking his fist resolutely at Charles, as
much as to say I understand you, he started into a
quick run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now, boys,” said Charles, “buckle to your oars
for your lives, and if you get to the shore so I can
reach the school-house before Stephen does, I’ll give
you half a dollar a piece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This of course added new life to the boys and increased
speed to the boat. Their little canoe flew
over the water almost like a bird, carrying a white
bone in her mouth, and leaving a long ripple on the
glassy wave behind her. Charles’ hands trembled,
but still he did good execution with his paddle. Although
Stephen upon the run was a very different
thing from Stephen at a slow walk, Charles still had
strong hopes of winning the race and gaining his
point. He several times caught glimpses of Stephen
through the trees, and, as well as he could judge, the
boat had a little the best of it. But when they came
out into the last opening, where for a little way they
had a fair view of each other, Charles thought Stephen
ran faster than ever; and although he was now
considerably nearer the school-house than Stephen
was, he still trembled for the result. They were
now within fifty rods of the shore, and Charles appealed
again to the boys’ love of money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Now,” said he, “we have not a minute to
spare. If we gain the point, I’ll give you a dollar
apiece.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The boys strained every nerve, and Charles’ paddle
made the water fly like the tail of a wounded shark.
When within half a dozen rods of the shore, Charles
urged them again to spring with all their might,
and one of the boys making a desperate plunge upon
his oar, snapped it in two. The first pull of the other
oar headed the boat from land. Charles saw at once
that the delay must be fatal, if he depended on the
boat to carry him ashore. The water was but three
feet deep, and the bottom was sandy. He sprung
from the boat, and rushed toward the shore as fast
as he was able to press through the water. He flew
up the bank, and along the road, till he reached the
school-house. The door was open, but he could see
no one within. Several children were at play round
the door, who, having seen Charles approach with
such haste, stood with mouths and eyes wide open,
looking at him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Where’s the schoolma’m?” said Charles, hastily,
to one of the largest boys.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Why?” said the boy, opening his eyes still
wider, “is any of the folks dead?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You little rascal, I say, where’s the schoolma’m?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She jest went down that road,” said the boy,
“two or three minutes ago.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Was she alone?” said Charles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“She started alone,” said the boy, “and a man
met her out there a little ways, and turned about and
went with her.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Charles felt that his cake was all dough again, and
that he might as well give it up for a bad job, and go
home. Stephen Jones and Lucy Brown walked very
leisurely home through the woods, and Charles and
the boys went very leisurely in the boat across the
pond. They even stopped by the way, and caught a
mess of fish, since the boys had thrown their lines
into the boat when they started. And when they
reached the wharf, Charles, in order to show that he
had been a fishing, took a large string of the fish in
his hand, and carried them up to the house. Miss
Lucy Brown, on her way home through the woods,
had undoubtedly been informed of the proposed tea-party
for the evening, to which she was to be invited,
and to which Stephen Jones and Susan Jones
were not invited; and when Miss Lucy’s invitation
came, she sent word back, that she was <span class='it'>engaged</span>.</p>

<h2 class='nobreak'>CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p class='pindent'>I was now alone in the world; I had neither ship,
nor home; and she I had loved was wedded to
another. It is strange how misanthropical a man
becomes, after disappointment has soured his disposition,
and destroyed, one after another, the beautiful
dreams of his youth. When I sat down and thought
of the hopes of my earlier years, now gone forever;
when I speculated upon my future prospects; when I
recalled to mind how few of the friends I had begun
life with remained, an indescribable sadness came
over me, and, had it not been for my manhood, I
would have found a relief in tears. My zest for
society was gone. I cared little for the ordinary
business of life. I only longed for a fitting opportunity
to re-enter the service, and distinguish myself by
some gallant deed, which I did not care to survive,
for even fame had become hateful to me, since it
reminded me how insufficient it was to win or retain
the love of woman. In a word, I had become a misanthrope,
and was fast losing all the energy of my
character in sickly regrets over the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the St. Clairs I had not inquired since my return,
and their names, from motives of delicacy
perhaps, were never mentioned in my presence.
Yet they occupied a large portion of my thoughts,
and often would I start, and my heart flutter, when,
in the streets, I fancied, for a moment, that I recognized
the form of Annette. But a nearer approach
made evident my mistake, and dissipated my embarrassment.
Much, however, as I thought of her, I
had never inquired to whom she had been married;
yet my curiosity on this point continually gained
strength; and when I had been a fortnight in Newport
without hearing any allusion to her, I began to
wish that some one would break the ominous silence
which seemed to hang around her and her family.
Still I dared not trust myself to broach the subject.
I continued, therefore, ignorant of their present
situation, and of all that concerned them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is, not far from the town, and situated in
one of the most beautiful portions of the island, a
favorite resort which has long been known by the
familiar and characteristic name of “The Glen.”
The spot is one where the deity of romance might
sit enshrined. Here, on a still summer night, we
might, without much stretch of fancy, look for fairies
to come forth and gambol, or listen to the light music
of airy spirits hovering above us. The whole place
reminds you of an enchanted bower, and dull must
be his heart who does not feel the stirrings of the
divinity within him as he gazes on the lovely scenery
around. He who can listen here unmoved to the low
gurgle of the brook, or the light rustle of the leaves
in the summer wind, must be formed of the coarsest
clods of clay, nor boast one spark of our immortal
nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The glen was my favorite resort, and thither would
I go and spend whole afternoons, listening to the
laughing prattle of the little river, or striving to
catch, in pauses of the breeze, the murmur of the
neighboring sea. A rude bench had been constructed
under some trees, in a partially open glade, at the
lower extremity of the ravine, and here I usually
sat, indulging in those dreamy, half-sick reveries
which are characteristic of youth. The stream,
which brawled down the ravine, in a succession of
rapids and cascades, here glided smoothly along on
a level bottom, its banks fringed with long grass
interspersed with wild roses, and its bed strewed
with pebbles, round and silvery, that glistened in the
sunbeams, which, here and there, struggled through
the trees, and shimmered on the stream. Faint and
low came to the ear the sound of the mill, situated
at the upper end of the ravine; while occasionally a
bird whistled on the stillness, or a leaf floated lazily
down into the river, and went on its way, a tiny
bark. The seclusion of my favorite retreat was
often enlivened by the appearance of strangers, but
as they generally remained only a few minutes, I
had the spot, for most of the time, to myself. Here
I dreamed away the long summer afternoons, often
lingering until the moon had risen, to make the
scene seem even more beautiful, under her silvery
light. I had no pleasure in any other spot. Perhaps
it was because I had once been here with Annette,
when we were both younger, and I, at least,
happier; and I could remember plucking a flower
for her from a time-worn bush that still grew on the
margin of the stream. God knows how we love to
haunt the spot made dear to us by old and tender
recollections!</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was sitting, one afternoon, on the rude bench I
have spoken of, listlessly casting pebbles into the
river, when I heard the sound of approaching voices,
but I was so accustomed to the visits of strangers,
that I did not pause to look up. Directly the voices
came nearer, and suddenly a word was spoken that
thrilled through every nerve of my system. It was
only a single word, but that voice!—surely it could
be none other than Annette’s. My sensations, at
that moment, I will not pretend to analyze. I longed
to look up, and yet I dared not. My heart fluttered
wildly, and I could feel the blood rushing in torrents
to my face; but, if I had been called on at that instant
to speak, I could not have complied for worlds.
Luckily the tree, under whose shadow I sat, concealed
me from the approaching visitors, and I had
thus time to rally my spirits ere the strangers came
up. As they drew near I recognized the voice of
Mr. St. Clair, and then that of Annette’s cousin Isabel,
while there were one or two other speakers
who were strangers to me. Doubtless one of them
was Annette’s husband, and, as this thought flashed
across me, I looked up, impelled by an irresistible
impulse. The party were now within almost twenty
yards, coming gaily down the glen. Foremost in
the group walked Isabel, leaning on the arm of a
tall, gentlemanly looking individual, and turning
ever and anon around to Annette, who followed immediately
behind, at the side of her father. Another
lady, attended by a gentleman, made up the rest of
the company. Where could Annette’s husband be?
was the question that occurred to me—and who was
the distinguished looking gentleman on whose arm
Isabel was so familiarly leaning? But my thoughts
were cut short by a conversation which now began,
and of which, during a minute, I was an unknown
auditor—for my position still concealed me from the
party, and my surprise at first, and afterwards delicacy,
prevented me from appearing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Ah! Annette,” said Isabel, archly, turning around
to her cousin, “do you know this spot, but especially
that rose-bush yonder?—here, right beyond that old
tree—you seem wonderfully ignorant all at once! I
wonder where the donor of that aforesaid rose-bud is
now. I would lay a guinea that it is yet in your possession,
preserved in some favorite book, pressed out
between the leaves. Come, answer frankly, is it not
so, my sweet coz?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I could hear no reply, if one was made, and immediately
another voice spoke. It was that of Isabel’s
companion, coming to the aid of Annette.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You are too much given to believe that Annette
follows your example, Isabel—now do you turn
penitent, and let me be father confessor—how many
rose-buds, ay! and for that matter, even leaves, have
you in your collection, presented to you by your
humble servant, before we had pity on each other,
and were married? I found a flower, last week, in
a copy of Spenser, and, if I remember aright, I was
the donor of the trifle.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Oh! you betray yourself,” gaily retorted Isabel,
“but men are foolish—and of all foolish men I ever
met with, a certain Albert Marston was, before his
marriage, the most foolish. I take credit to myself,”
she continued, in the same playful strain, “for
having worked such a reformation in him since that
event. But this is not what we were talking of—you
wish to divert me from my purpose by this light
Cossack warfare—but it won’t do,” she continued,
and I fancied she stamped her foot prettily, as she
was wont to do at Clairville Hall, when she was disposed
to have her way; “no—no—Annette must be
the one to turn penitent, and I will play father confessor.
Say, now, fair coz, was it not a certain fancy
to see this same rose-bush, that induced you to insist
on coming here?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>During this conversation the parties had remained
nearly stationary at some distance from me. Strange
suspicions began to flash through my mind, as soon
as Isabel commenced her banter; and these suspicions
had now been changed into a certainty.
Annette was still unmarried, and it was Isabel’s
wedding at which I had come so near being present,
at Clairville Hall. Nor was this all. I was still
loved. Oh! the wild, the rapturous feelings of that
moment. I could with difficulty restrain myself
from rising and rushing toward them; but motives
of delicacy forbade me thus to reveal that the conversation
had been overheard. And yet should I
remain in my present position, and play the listener
still further? I knew not what to do. All these
considerations flashed through my mind in the space
of less than a minute, during which the party had
been silent, apparently enjoying Annette’s confusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“Come, not ready to answer yet?” began Isabel;
“well, if you will not, you shan’t have the rose from
that bush, for which you’ve come. Let us go back,”
she said, playfully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole party seemed to enter into the jest, and
laughingly retraced their steps. This afforded me
the opportunity for which I longed. Hastily rising
from my seat, I glided unnoticed from tree to tree,
until I reached a copse on the left of the glen, and
advancing up the ravine, under cover of this screen,
I re-entered the path at a bend some distance above
the St. Clairs. Here I listened for a moment, and
caught the sound of their approaching voices. Determining
no longer to be a listener to their conversation,
I proceeded down the glen, and, as I turned
the corner, a few paces in advance, I came full in
sight of the approaching group. In an instant the
gay laughing of the party ceased, and I saw Annette
shrink blushing behind her father. Isabel was the
first to speak. Darting forward, with that frankness
and gaiety which always characterized her, she
grasped my hand, and said⁠—</p>

<p class='pindent'>“You don’t know how happy we all are to see
you. Where could you have come from?—and how
could you have made such a mistake as to congratulate
Annette, instead of me, on being married? But
come, I must surrender you to the others—I see they
are dying to speak to you. Uncle, Annette—how
lucky it was that we came here to-day!”</p>

<p class='pindent'>“My dear boy,” said Mr. St. Clair, warmly pressing
my hand, “I cannot tell how rejoiced I am to
see you. We heard a rumor that you were lost, and
we all wept—Isabel for the first time for years. It
was but a few days since that we heard you were at
Newport, and, as we were coming hither, I hastened
my journey, determined to search you out. We are
on our way there now, and only stopped here a few
minutes to relieve ourselves after a long ride. This
day shall be marked with a white stone. But here I
have been keeping you from speaking to Annette—we
old men, you know, are apt to be garrulous.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>My eyes, indeed, had been seeking Annette, who,
still covered with blushes, and unable to control her
embarrassment, sought to conceal them by keeping
in the back ground. As for me, I had become wonderfully
self-possessed. I now advanced and took
her hand. It trembled in my own, and when I
spoke, though she replied faintly, she did not dare
to look into my face, except for a moment, after
which her eyes again sought the ground in beautiful
embarrassment. My unexpected appearance, combined
with her cousin’s late raillery, covered her
face with blushes, and, for some time, she could not
rally herself sufficient to participate in the conversation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What more have I to tell? I was now happy,
and for my misanthropy, it died with the cause that
produced it. Mr. St. Clair said that the wedding
need not be delayed, and in less than a month I led
Annette to the altar. Years have flown since then,
but I still enjoy unalloyed felicity, and Annette seems
to my eyes more beautiful than ever. It only remains
for me to bid my readers <span style='font-size:smaller'>FAREWELL</span>!</p>

<div><h1><a id='lad'></a>THE LADIES’ LIBRARY.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY W. A. JONES.</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>That admirable manual of “<span class='it'>les petites morales</span>,”
and even of higher matters occasionally, the Spectator,
contains a paper which we hesitate not to accept
as a just specimen of cotemporary satire on female
education; we refer to the catalogue of a Ladies’
Library. This heterogeneous collection embraces
heroical romances and romancing histories, the ranting
tragedies of the day, with the libertine comedies
of the same period. In a word, it leads us to infer
pretty plainly the insignificant pretensions the gentle
women of Queen Anne’s day could lay to any thing
like refinement of education, or even a correct propriety
in dress and demeanor. Tell me your company,
and I will disclose your own character; speak
that I may know you, are trite maxims; but give me a
list of your favorite authors is by no means so common,
though at least as true, a test. The literary
and indirectly the moral depravity of taste exhibited
by the women of that age, is easily accounted for,
when we once learn the fashionable authors and the
indifferent countenance given to any authors but those
of the most frivolous description. The queen herself
was an illiterate woman, and we are told never once
had the curiosity to look into the classic productions
of Pope. King William, the preceding sovereign,
was so ignorant of books and the literary character,
as to offer Swift, with whom he had been agreeably
prepossessed, the place of captain of a regiment of
horse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indulging ourselves in a rapid transition, we pass
from this era to the epoch of Johnson and Burke, and
Goldsmith and Sheridan, we come to the reign of
George III. Here we find the scene altered. From
the gay saloon we are dropped, as if by magic, into the
library or conversation room. We read not of balls,
but of literary dinners and æsthetic teas, and we meet
for company, not thoughtless, dressy dames of fashion
and minions of the goddess of pleasure, but grave, precise
professors in petticoats, women who had exchanged
a world of anxiety for the turn of a head-dress,
or the shape of a flounce for an equally wise
anxiety about the philosophy of education, the success
of their sonnets and tragedies, and moral tales for the
young. The pedantry of authorship and dogmatic
conversation superseded the more harmless pedantry
of dress. Then we read of the stupidest company in
the world, which arrogated to itself the claim of being
the best. A race of learned ladies arose; <span class='it'>bas bleus</span>,
the Montagues, the Mores, the Sewards, the Chapones,
patronized by such prosing old formalists as
Doctors Gregory and Aiken, and even by one man
of vigorous talent, Johnson, and one man of real
genius, Richardson. The last two endured much,
because they were flattered much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When we speak thus contemptuously of learned
ladies, we intend to express a disgust at the pretensions
of those who pass under that name. Genuine
learning can never be despised, whoever may be its
possessor; but of genuine learning it is not harsh to
suspect a considerable deficiency where there is so
much of display and anxious rivalry. Even where
the learning is exact and solid, it is to be remembered
that many departments are utterly unsuited to the
female mind; where, at best, little can be accomplished
and that of a harsh repulsive nature. We
want no Daciers, no Somervilles, no Marcets, but
give us as you will as many Inchbalds, Burneys,
Edgeworths, Misses Barrett, as can be had for love
or money.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the ladies we seek literature, not learning,
in its old scholastic sense. They certainly have received
pleasure from books, and are bound to return
the gratification in a similar way by delighting us.
And this they can do in their legitimate attempts. It
shall be a prominent object of the present general
introduction to a short series of critical sketches, to
attempt a definition of the limits which should bound
those attempts, and also to endeavor at suggesting
the proper studies for ladies, and the authors that
ought to rank as favorites with the fair. In a list of
the latter, female writers should bear a considerable
proportion, and will assuredly not be forgotten.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We believe the question as to the relative sexual
distinctions of intellectual character, is now generally
considered as settled. There is allowed to be a species
of genius essentially feminine. Equality is no
more arrogated than superiority of ability, and it
would be as wisely arrogated. The most limited
observation of life and the most superficial acquaintance
with books, must effectually demonstrate the
superior capacity of man for the great works of life
and speculation. It is true, great geniuses are rare
and seldom needed, and the generality of women
rank on a par with the generality of men. In many
cases, women of talent surpass men of an equal
calibre of mere talent, through other and constitutional
causes—a greater facility of receiving and transmitting
impressions, greater instinctive subtlety of apprehension,
and a livelier sympathy. We cordially
admit the female intellect, in the ordinary concerns
of life and the current passages of society, has often
the advantage of the masculine understanding. Cleverness
outshines solid ability, and a smart woman
is much more showy than a profound man. In certain
walks of authorship, too, women are pre-eminently
successful; in cases narrative of real or
fictitious events, (in the last implying a strain of
ready invention,) in lively descriptions of natural
beauty or artificial manners; in the development of
the milder sentiments, especially the sentiment of
love; in airy, comic ridicule. On the other hand,
the highest attempts of women in poetry have uniformly
failed. We have read of no female epic of
even a respectable rank: those who have written
tragedies, have written moral lectures (of an inferior
sort) like Hannah More; or anatomies of the passions,
direct and formal, like Joanna Baillie; or an historical
sketch, as Rienzi. We are apt to suspect that
the personal charms of Sappho proved too much for
the admirers of her poetic rhapsodies, otherwise
Longinus has done her foul injustice; for the fragment
he quotes is to be praised and censured solely
for its obscurity. This would have been a great
merit in Lycophron.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the volume of British Poetesses, edited by Mr.
Dyce, it is astonishing to find how little real poetry
he has been able to collect out of the writings of
near a century of authors, scattered over the surface
of five or six centuries. It must be allowed that
some of the finest shortest pieces by female writers
have appeared since the publication of that selection.
In the volume referred to, much sensible verse and
some sprightly copies of verses occur; a fair share
of pure reflective sentiment, delivered in pleasing
language rarely rising above correctness; of high
genius there is not a particle,—no pretensions to sublimity
or fervor. The best piece and the finest
poem, we think, ever composed by woman, is the
charming ballad of Auld Robin Gray. That is a
genuine bit of true poesy, and perfect in the highest
department of the female imagination in the pathos
of domestic tragedy. In the present century we
have Mrs. Howitt and Mrs. Southey, but chief of all,
Miss Barrett.<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a> The finest attempts of the most
pleasing writer of this class, do not rise so high as
the delightful ballad above named. They are sweet,
plaintive, moral strains, the melodious notes of a
lute, tuned by taper fingers in a romantic bower, not
the deep, majestic, awful tones of the great organ,
or the spirited and stirring blasts of the trumpet.
The ancient bard struck wild and mournful, or hearty
and vigorous, notes from his harp—perchance placed
“on a rock whose frowning brow,” &amp;c. and striving
with the rough symphonies of the tempest; but the
sybil of modern days plays elegant and pretty, or soft
and tender airs upon her flageolet or accordion, in
the boudoir or saloon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A poet is, from the laws both of physiology and
philology,—masculine. His vocation is manly, or
rather divine. And we have never heard any traits
of feminine character attributed to the great poet, (in
the Greek sense,) the Creator of the universe. The
muses are represented as females, but then they are
the inspirers, never the composers, of verse. So
should be the poet’s muse, as she is often the poet’s
theme. There are higher themes, but of an abstract
nature, in general: ethical, religious, metaphysical.
Let female beauty then sit for her portrait instead of
being the painter. Let poets chant her charms, but
let her not spoil a fair ideal image by writing bad
verses. If all were rightly viewed, a happy home
would seem preferable to a seat on Parnassus, and the
Fountain of Content would furnish more palatable
draughts than the Font of Helicon. The quiet home
is not always the muses’ bower; though we trust the
muses’ bower is placed in no turbulent society.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women write for women. They may entertain,
but cannot, from the nature of the case, become instructors
to men. They know far less of life, their
circle of experience is confined. They are unfitted
for many paths of active exertion, and consequently
are rendered incapable of forming just opinions on
many matters. We do not include a natural incapacity
for many studies, and as natural a dislike for
many more. Many kinds of learning, and many actual
necessary pursuits and practices, it is deemed
improper for a refined woman to know. How, then,
<span class='it'>can</span> a female author become a teacher of men?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Literature would miss many pleasant associations
if the names of the best female writers were expunged
from a list of classic authors, and the world
would lose many delightful works—the novel of
sentiment and the novel of manners, letter writing,
moral tales for children, books of travels, gossiping
memoirs—Mrs. Inchbald, Madame D’Arblay, Miss
Edgeworth, Lady M. W. Montague, Miss Martineau,
and Miss Sedgwick, with a host besides. Women
have sprightliness, cleverness, smartness, though but
little wit. There is a body and substance in true
wit, with a reflectiveness rarely found apart from a
masculine intellect. In all English comedy, we recollect
but two female writers of sterling value,
Mrs. Conley and Mrs. Guthrie, and their plays are
formed on the Spanish model, and made up of incident
and intrigue, much more than of fine repartees or
brilliant dialogue. We know of no one writer of the
other sex, that has a high character for humor—no
Rabelais, no Sterne, no Swift, no Goldsmith, no
Dickens, no Irving. The female character does not
admit of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women cannot write history. It requires too
great solidity, and too minute research for their
quick intellects. They write, instead, delightful
memoirs. Who, but an antiquary or historical
commentator, had not rather read Lucy Hutchinson’s
Life of her Husband, than any of the professed
histories of the Commonwealth—and exchange Lady
Fanshawe for the other royalist biographers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neither are women to turn politicians or orators.
We hope never to hear of a female Burke; she
would be an overbearing termagant. A spice of a
talent for scolding, is the highest form of eloquence
we can conscientiously allow the ladies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Criticism is for men; when women assume it,
they write scandal. The current notion of criticism
with most, is that of libelous abuse. From all such,
Heaven defend us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Women feel more than they think, and (sometimes)
say more than do. They are consequently better
adapted to describe sentiments, than to speculate on
causes and effects. They are more at home in their
letters, than in tracts of political economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proper faculties in women to cultivate most
assiduously are, the taste and the religious sentiment;
the first, as the leading trait of the intellectual; and
the last, as the governing power of the moral constitution.
Give a woman a pure taste and high principles,
and she is safe from the arts of the wiliest
libertine. Let her have all other gifts but these, and
she is comparatively defenceless. Taste purifies the
heart as well as the head, and religion strengthens
both. The strongest propensities to pleasure are not
so often the means of disgrace and ruin, as the carelessness
of ignorant virtue, and an unenlightened
moral sense. This makes all the difference in the
world, between the daughter of a poor countryman,
and the child of an educated gentleman. Both have
the same desires, but how differently directed and
controlled. Yet we find nineteen lapses from virtue
in the one case, where we find one in the other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Believing that what does not interest, does not
benefit the mind, we would avoid all pedantic lectures
to women, on all subjects to which they discover
any aversion. Study should be made a pleasure,
and reading pure recreation. In a general
sense, we would say the best works for female
readers are those that tend to form the highest
domestic character. Works of the highest imagination,
as being above that condition, and scientific
authors, who address a different class of faculties,
are both unsuitable. An admirable wife may not
relish the sublimity of Milton or Hamlet; and a
charming companion be ignorant of the existence of
such a science as Algebra. A superficial acquaintance
with the elements of the physical sciences, is
worse than total unacquaintance with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Religion should be taught as a sentiment, not as an
abstract principle, or in doctrinal positions, a sentiment
of love and grateful obedience; morality, impressed
as the practical exercise of self-denial and
active benevolence. In courses of reading, too much
is laid down of a dry nature. Girls are disgusted
with tedious accounts of battles and negotiations,
dates and names. The moral should be educed best
filled for the female heart, and apart from the romantic
periods, and the reigns of female sovereigns, or
epochs when the women held a very prominent
place in the state, or in public regard. We would
have women affectionate wives, obedient daughters,
agreeable companions, skilful economists, judicious
friends; but we must confess it does not fall within
our scheme to make them legislators or lawyers,
diplomatists or politicians. We therefore think
nine tenths of all history is absolutely useless for
women. Too many really good biographies of great
and good men and women can hardly be read, and
will be read to much greater advantage than histories,
as they leave a definite and individual impression.
The reading good books of travels, is,
next to going over the ground in person, the best
method of studying geography. Grammar and rhetoric,<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a>
(after a clear statement of the elements and
chief rules,) are best learnt in the perusal of classic
authors, the essayists, &amp;c.; and, in the same way,
the theory of taste and the arts. The most important
of accomplishments is not systematically treated in
any system—conversation. But a father and mother
of education, can teach this better than any professor.
Expensive schools turn out half-trained pupils.
Eight years at home, well employed, and two at a
good but not fashionable school, are better than ten
years spent in the most popular female seminary,
conducted in the ordinary style. Such is a meagre
outline of our idea of female education, into which
we have digressed unawares.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Female authors should constitute a fair proportion
of a lady’s library—and those masculine writers who
have something of the tenderness and purity of the
feminine character in their works. The subjects
and authors we propose for occasional consideration,
will embrace specimens of each, in prose and
poetry, fiction and reality, satire and sentiment. We
think we may promise a less erudite paper for the
second number, though to some readers all that is
not very lively is proportionably dull.</p>

<div><h1><a id='has'></a>THE HASTY MARRIAGE.</h1></div>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1em;font-weight:bold;'>A SKETCH FROM REAL LIFE.</p>

<p class='line' style='text-align:center;'>———</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;font-size:0.8em;font-weight:bold;'>BY THE AUTHOR OF “THE BRIDAL.”</p>
<p class='line' style='text-align:center;margin-bottom:1.5em;'>———</p>

<p class='pindent'>How few “look before they leap,” even in an affair
of so much moment as matrimony. We fear the
fault is in our system. We educate our daughters
superficially—for <span class='it'>display</span> rather than usefulness—to
catch the eye rather than win the heart. Our girls
are taught in early life, either directly or indirectly,
that marriage is the great object of woman’s ambition,
and in endeavoring to secure that object, and to surpass
in the race of conquest their companions and
rivals, they sometimes wed rashly and to the sacrifice
of happiness. Difficult, we are aware, is the task
of discrimination with the young and inexperienced.
Pure and artless themselves, they are apt to imagine
the possession of like virtues by all others, and to
conceive it impossible for a fine form and a handsome
face to be associated with a false heart. Alas!
how often are they disappointed! How frequently
do the sudden attachments of early life prove hollow
and unsubstantial! How often is it discovered that
the first dream of love, which has been so extravagantly
eulogized by poets and romancers, was a mere
delusion that would not bear the test of time and of
reason! With what bitterness of disappointment
have many started from this dream! Stripped of the
rainbow coloring with which the fancy is apt to paint
an object of idolatry, how prominent appear the darkness
and the deformity! How broad the contrast
between the just view of truth and the rapid and prejudiced
survey of passion! How often do we see
beings standing before the altar, pledging themselves
to each other for weal and for wo, who, comparatively
speaking, were strangers but yesterday!
Knowing little of each other’s lives and dispositions,
merits or demerits, they are willing to risk peace of
mind for long years, and to identify destinies for time,
perhaps for eternity! Can we wonder that strife
sometimes mars the domestic circle—that wives are
left lonely and deserted—that the agency of man
should so often be invoked to part beings who have
been joined together by an ordinance of God!</p>

<p class='pindent'>A happy union is indeed a scene upon which, without
irreverence, we may suppose the angels in Heaven
gaze from their bright places of abode with
delight and approval. An unnatural or a discordant
marriage, on the other hand, must form a source of
delight to the arch enemy of mankind, for in it he
can recognize the soul of evil. That the young
should seek for and cling to a kindred spirit is natural.
The undivided possession of a pure heart is perhaps
the very acme of human felicity. “One home, one
wife, and one God,” is the sentiment of one of the
wisest of his race, and it is only when man is on the
shady side of fifty that he begins to appreciate the
truth of this philosophy in all its solemnity and force.
Then his pleasures of life are derived as much from
the past as the future, and the associations of that
past, if mingled with virtue, fidelity, patriotism and
religion, are indeed blissful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We pity the lonely and the desolate—the loveless
and the unloved—the being without a wife or a friend—without
one trusting and confiding spirit, to whom
the heart may turn in its hour of sorrow and pour out
its inmost and saddest thoughts. The cold and selfish
mortal who passes year after year without experiencing
the delightful concord of sentiment to be found in
a kindred soul, is indeed the most miserable of his
species. Even his joys are robbed of half their delight,
because unshared by another, by one to whom
he is allied by love and friendship. Wretched indeed
is the isolated individual who, mingling with
the multitude, can single out no destiny identified
with his—no faithful and devoted heart, the breath of
whose existence seems bound up with his. Nature
has denied to such a being the holiest impulses
that warm and agitate the human breast. Even the
birds are mated, and without a ministering angel “a
sweet companion,” the first born was lonely and
desolate in the garden of Eden. So it must ever be
with the frail and feeble things of mortal existence.
If Paradise could not be appreciated and enjoyed
alone, how can man reconcile loneliness to his fallen
condition? The desire of the heart is for sweet companionship—the
inward craving of the spirit is for a
being to love. Can we wonder then that in this
country, where early marriage is taught to be desirable,
so many should choose rashly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We remember <span class='sc'>Annette Delisle</span> as a being of
yesterday. She sang well—she danced well—and in
many respects she was a beauty. Not one of our
beauties at the time, for her form was too slight and
sylph-like,—her joy was too gushing—her spirits too
redundant. She dressed from early childhood with
taste and elegance, and wore her dark hair in long
ringlets over her shoulders. She had many friends,
and even at sixteen her admirers were liberal in
number and profuse in flattery. Her mother, a
weak and vain woman, was proud of her daughter—proud
of the attention that daughter received, and
eager to display her on every occasion. Thus she
not only frequently accompanied her to public balls,
which were then more fashionable and somewhat
more select than at present, but she permitted her to
accept of numerous invitations to parties, and to
mingle almost nightly during the winter season in
the gay scenes of our metropolis. The father, good-natured
man, was a manufacturer, and was so wedded
to business, that he could not spare time even
for the proper care of his favorite child. Alas!
this good nature in fathers! It sometimes degenerates
into a sad vice, and is the source of much
misery in after life. The man who lacks the energy
to control his own household,—who is either too
negligent, or too weak to point out the true path and
to direct the footsteps of his offspring therein, is
guilty of much that is unpardonable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But such a father was Mr. Delisle, while the mother,
worse if possible, gave the reins almost wholly
into the hands of her daughter, and was but too fond of
the hollow and unmeaning admiration which the practiced
in art and in compliment among the sterner sex
are so apt to bestow upon the vain and empty, whether
old or young.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this course upon Annette Delisle may
well be imagined. While she sparkled in the ball
room, and glittered in the giddy throng, her heart,
her mind, and her morals were neglected. The
mazes of the world, its quicksands and its hypocrisy
were unknown to her. She flirted, laughed and
trifled with the many, caught one hour by a fine
form, another by a rich voice, and a third by a dashing
exterior. And yet, in the depths of that young
girl’s breast, were rich and true affections. Properly
trained, she would have graced any circle. Her
mind was good by nature—her spirit was benevolent
and cheerful—and many of the lights of beauty
flashed and brightened around her. Despite her
artificial manner, and her air of coquetry, her feelings
were deep and strong. Her being was one of
impulse, and her attachments, even to her school
companions, were animated by truth and fidelity.
Thus it was when Annette discovered that the society
of Howard Leroy possessed an unusual charm for
her—that she saw him approach with pleasure—that
she listened with more than her wonted attention
to his remarks—that she felt the blood mount to
her cheek at his compliments—that she found her
eyes following as he wandered through the ball
room—that she lisped his name even in her dreams.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Never can I forget the dashing Leroy. He was
what is usually denominated “a handsome fellow”—one
of the butterflies of society—a ladies’ man,
in the general acceptation, and a favorite also with
his own sex. He rode well, talked well, and sang
an excellent song. This latter qualification was in
some respects a fatal gift, for it introduced him into
many a gay circle from which he otherwise would
have been excluded—made him sought for, and vain
of his voice, and thus won him away from the more
useful pursuits of life. Leroy, moreover, was fond of
poetry—was able to quote glowing passages, and had,
withal, a touch of romance in his character, which
served not a little to enhance him in the estimation
of some of his female acquaintance. He assumed a
remarkable degree of independence—was rather
bold and reckless in his manner and language, and
possessed the faculty of talking for hours in relation
to the prominent beauties of Moore, Byron and Bulwer.
These were the traits of character which won
upon the mind and heart of Annette Delisle. Her
education and mode of life had fitted her for the arts
of such a man. She fancied him something superior
to the ordinary fop—to the mere merchant or shopkeeper.
Leroy became her ardent and enthusiastic
admirer. The fact soon reached the ears of her
father. He roused himself for the moment, and proceeded
to investigate the realities of the case. Leroy
he ascertained to be an idle, dissolute pretender, and
dependent, he feared, upon the gaming-table for his
means of subsistence. He was of good family, and
had received a fair education. But he had gone
astray from the path of rectitude in early life, and
now contrived to appear on the principal promenades
as a fashionable lounger—but the world wondered
how!</p>

<p class='pindent'>The manufacturer was terrified at the prospect for
his daughter, whom he really loved, but it was too
late. Leroy saw the storm coming, and prevailed
upon Annette, by falsehood and misrepresentation,
to consent to a secret marriage. Fondly and long
she clung to the delusion that her husband had been
slandered—that one who could <span class='it'>talk</span> so well, and <span class='it'>profess</span>
so much, could not be a villain. He <span class='it'>was</span> not
one, perhaps, in the usual interpretation; but we
can conceive of no more heartless wretch than the
man who deliberately deceives and betrays a fond
and confiding woman. Leroy never loved Annette
with a true and exalted affection. He felt himself
bankrupt in fortune, and nearly so in character, and
he was base enough to become the husband of an
unsuspecting girl, in the hope of a dependency upon
the bounty of her father. Deceived in this, for the
old manufacturer would have nothing to do with
him, he soon threw off the mask. At first cold and
indifferent, he speedily grew harsh and unkind.
True, there were moments when his better nature
prevailed, and he would endeavor, by apparent contrition
and well turned promises, to atone for his conduct.
But, they were few and far between, and
diminished in number as time rolled on. Strange,
despite the giddy character of Annette—despite the
little care which had been bestowed upon her principles,
she clung to him with the true fidelity of
woman. She loved him with her whole soul, and
while the pride of her woman nature repelled the
idea of any public exposure of her situation, and
while she even concealed from her parents much of
the unworthy conduct of Leroy, she still cherished
a belief of his ultimate reform. Night after
night she sat in her quiet chamber, or gazed earnestly
from the window, in the hope that the form of
her husband might appear before the midnight
hour. Who may paint the agony of her mind at such
moments—the jealous fears that shot like daggers
through her breast, as to his haunts and his society—the
apprehension of danger and of death—the terrible
fancies which mingled him in some dreadful scene at
the gaming table—and, worse than all, the oft repelled,
but still returning conviction, that the wine
cup was too familiar with his lips!</p>

<p class='pindent'>God, in pity look down upon and impart moral
courage to the lonely wives of the world—the dejected
ones to whom home is desolate, whose hearts
are breaking slowly, secretly, string by string—who
live only for their little ones, and because they know
it wrong to plunge unbidden into eternity! Beings
who have ventured their all of earthly happiness,
and have lost all—who have been deceived, betrayed,
and are now deserted! Pity and console
them, Great Creator, for the misery of unrequited
love, of wounded pride, of crushed affection, of
hopeless despair throughout this life, can only be
soothed and softened by a heavenly influence!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Poor Annette! Step by step her husband plunged
on in the downward path. Ray after ray departed
from the light of her beauty. Wider and wider became
the gulf between the manufacturer and his
son-in-law. But, horror of horrors! the crisis soon
came! The resource of gambling failed at last with
Leroy, and <span class='it'>then</span>—he resorted to forgery!—ay! he
forged the name of George Delisle, the father of his
wife, and fled the country in order to escape the
penalty of his crime!</p>

<hr class='tbk122'/>

<p class='pindent'>But a few days have gone by since we saw Annette.
Only five years have elapsed since her marriage.
What a change! The lily has supplanted
the rose—the eye has lost its fire—the step its buoyancy—the
form its grace. She is a doomed and
broken hearted woman. Disease has “marked her
for his own.” Loss of sleep—mental anxiety—the
disgrace—the shame—the ignominy of her husband’s
career, are hurrying her rapidly to a premature
grave!</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mothers, be warned! Virtue, Integrity and Religion
are the only safe companions for your budding
and beautiful daughters!</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We are among those who believe that, as characterizing
the present age, the cultivation of purely mechanical and
natural science has been carried much too far, or rather,
has been made too exclusive and absorbing. It is not the
<span class='it'>highest</span> science—for it concerns only that which is around
us—which is altogether outward. Man is always greater
than the world of nature in which he lives, and just as
clearly must the <span class='it'>science</span> of man, the philosophy of his moral
and intellectual being, rank far above that of the soulless
creation which was made to minister to his wants. When,
therefore, this lower science so draws to itself the life of
any age, as to disparage and shut out the higher, it works a
positive injury to the well-being of that age. Still it is
only thus in comparison with a nobler and more lofty study
that we would venture to cast the faintest reproach upon
that natural science which in no slight degree absorbs the
intellectual effort of the present generation. Regarded as
related to, and a part of, a complete system of education, it
becomes most important and necessary; and its cultivation,
even to apparent excess, a cause of rejoicing and a source
of the highest hope.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We need scarcely say, then, that we look upon the explorations
which have been made “by authority” into the
Geology and general Natural History of several of the most
important States in the Union, as among the proudest
achievements of the present day. Most of them, it is true,
grew out of designs not the highest on the part of those by
whom they were originated. The development of resources,
the discovery of mineral wealth, or other elements
of power, formed in most cases the principal aim of those
at whose instance these surveys were undertaken. But
this is of little importance. The results are, on this account,
none the less valuable to the cause of natural science,
nor is our joy at their successful prosecution the less ardent
or sincere. In all the States in which they have been undertaken,
they have been fruitful of the best results; and
the facts thus brought together will be found of priceless
value to students and inquirers for ages to come.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The State of New York has just completed her survey,
which has been conducted on a scale commensurate with
her wealth and enterprise. The different departments of
the survey were, in 1836, assigned to eight gentlemen well
qualified for the task, and from that time until their completion,
the explorations were conducted with energy and
enthusiasm. The reports are to be published in ten magnificent
quarto volumes, of which the first is now before
us. A more splendid monument of intelligent enterprise
in the cause of science, has seldom been erected by any
State. The first volume contains only a portion of the first
report on Zoology, by Mr. <span class='sc'>James E. DeKay</span>, to whom this
department was committed. Governor Seward has written
an introduction to the work, which occupies nearly two
hundred pages. It is valuable as a historical record of the
progress of the arts, the sciences, and the various branches
of enterprise and industry in the State, though as a literary
performance it can claim no especial merit. It is, indeed,
little more than a compendium of the history of the State,
and of its general statistics, of which the different portions
have been contributed by different persons. The portion of
the Zoological Report which this volume contains—relating
merely to the Mammalia of the State—is highly valuable,
and, to the naturalist, exceedingly interesting. Previous
to this survey, no complete Zoology of the State had
been attempted. In 1813, Samuel L. Mitchell commenced
an account of the fishes of New York, which was the first
work on the subject ever undertaken; and the impulse
given to the science by his labors in fact laid the foundation
for whatever has been effected in the same department
since. Several other branches of Zoology had received
some slight attention before the commencement of the State
survey. Bachman, a well known naturalist of South
Carolina, had made interesting discoveries in the families
of smaller quadrupeds, and much valuable information
concerning the ornithology of the State had been collected
by Wilson, Audubon, Cooper, Bonaparte and DeKay.
Barnes had classified the Unionidæ of the lakes and rivers,
and the Mollusca of the sea coast had been well studied by
Dr. Gay, of New York city. But the report of Mr. DeKay
in this department presents by far a more full and comprehensive
account of the Zoology of New York than had
ever before been made. The State was divided into four
Zoological districts: first, the western district, embracing
all the western portion of the State, as far east as the
sources of the Mohawk; second, the northern, comprising
all that portion of the State lying north of the Mohawk
valley; third, the valley of the Hudson, including all the
counties watered by that river and its tributaries; and
fourth, the Atlantic district, embracing Long Island. In
regard to its natural history, the northern district is by far
the most important. Strange as it may seem to those who
are accustomed to hear only of the wealth, the refinement,
and the advanced civilization of the “Empire State,” there
is embraced in this northern district a great tract of a thousand
square miles, lying in loneliness, fresh as it came from
the hand of God, untouched, and almost unvisited by man.
It is clad with forests of great and majestic beauty, echoing
only the sigh of the tempest, the screams of the untamed
dwellers in its wilds, and now and then the rifle of the
hunter, who there finds game, such as in long gone times
the red men loved to chase. It is thickly overspread with
lakes, embosomed in mountains, now lying calmly and
smilingly beneath the sun, and the next hour lashed into
frowns, when</p>

<p class='pindent'>This vast wild region is inhabited by many animals that
are rarely found in any other portion of the State. The
bear, the moose, the panther, the deer, and most fur-bearing
animals, make their homes among its mountains. Arctic
birds, too, that are never known farther south, are seen in
abundance. The whole district covers an area of about six
thousand square miles. The western district is eminent for
its fertility and beauty, and has also a high degree of zoological
interest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The number of quadrupeds enumerated in the report, as
found within the State, is something more than one hundred.
Each of these is scientifically and fully described. Included
in the volume are a great number of illustrations, taken
with the greatest care from the living animals or the best
specimens that could be found. The real colors are preserved,
and in every case the relative size is indicated.
The outlines, for the purpose of accuracy, were always
taken with a camera lucida, and the illustrations, drawn by
Hill, were lithographed by Endicott.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The whole style of the work is eminently worthy the enterprise,
results of which it contains, and the State which
undertook its fulfilment. We look for the forthcoming
volumes with no little interest. The botanical department
has been under the charge of John Toney; the mineralogical
and chemical were assigned to Lewis C. Beck; the geological
to W. W. Mather, Ebenezer Emmons, James Hall,
and Leonard Vanuxem, and the palæontological to Timothy
A. Conrad. Beside these reports, the results of the survey
appear in eight several collections of specimens of the animals,
plants, soils, minerals, rocks and fossils, found within
the State—one of which collections constitutes a museum
of natural history at the capital of the State, and the others
are distributed among collegiate institutions. We rejoice
at the completion of this great survey, and hope soon to see
a similar exploration effected in every State of the Union.
The cause of science will receive from it an aid of which
scientific men alone can rightly estimate the value.</p>

author of “The Life of Mohammed,” etc., and Professor
of Hebrew in the New York City University. New York,
Dayton &amp; Newman.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Bush is one of the most profound and ingenious
scholars and critics of the present age, and we perceive
with pleasure that he is rapidly multiplying the fruits of
his industrious pen. To all the lovers of sound biblical exposition
it must be gratifying to know that the Hebrew
Scriptures are in a fair way to develop their riches to the
English reader more fully than ever before. Professor
Bush’s commentaries on the Old Testament, now extending
to six volumes, embrace all the works of the Pentateuch
but the last two, and these, we learn, he proposes shortly
to enter upon. His careful study, his scrupulous fidelity
in eliciting the exact meaning of the original, and his peculiar
tact in explaining it, have made his Notes everywhere
popular, so that before the completion of the series, the first
volume has reached a sixth edition, the second a fifth, etc.
In all of them will be found discussions on the most important
points of biblical science, extending far beyond the
ordinary dimensions of expository notes, and amounting in
fact to elaborate dissertations of great value. Among the
subjects thus extensively treated are, in Genesis, the temptation
and the fall, the dispersion from Babel, the prophecies
of Noah, the character of Melchizedec, the destruction of
Sodom and Gomorrah, the history of Joseph, and the prophetical
benedictions of Jacob; in Exodus, the hardening
of Pharaoh’s heart, the miracles of the magicians, the pillar
of cloud as the seat of the Shekinah, the decalogue, the Hebrew
theocracy, the tabernacle, the cherubim, the candle-stick,
the shew bread, the altar, &amp;c.; in Leviticus, a clear
and minute specification of the different sacrifices, the law
of marriage, including the case of marriage with a deceased
wife’s sister, very largely considered, and a full account of
the Jewish festivals. The sixth volume, including Joshua
and Judges, contains an ample and erudite exposition of
the Song of Deborah, and an extended discussion on the
subject of Jeptha’s vow, with a view to determine whether
the Jewish warrior really sacrificed his daughter. The
Professor gives an array of very strong reasons in favor of
the negative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his celebrated “Treatise on the Millennium,” which
merely as a literary performance has received the highest
commendations of the critics, our author has assumed
the position that the millennium, <span class='it'>strictly so called</span>, is past.
But by the millennium he does not understand the golden
age of the church, which he, in common with nearly all
good men, regards as a future era. He contends that as
the memorable period of the thousand years of the apocalypse
is distinguished mainly by the binding of the symbolical
dragon, we must first determine by the legitimate
canons of interpretation what is shadowed forth by this
mystic personage, before we can assure ourselves of the
true character of the millennial age. But the dragon, he
supposes, is the grand hieroglyphic of Paganism—the
“binding of the dragon,” but a figurative phrase for the
suppression of Paganism within the limits of the Roman
empire, a fulfilment which he contends commenced in the
reign of Constantine, and was consummated in that of
Theodosius, his successor. Professor Bush draws largely
on the pages of Gibbon in support of his theory, assuming
all along the great foundation principle that <span class='it'>the apocalypse
of John is but a series of pictured emblems, shadowing
forth the ecclesiastical and civil history of the world</span>. From
a cursory examination of his Treatise, we are inclined to
adopt the opinion of one of the first theologians of our
country, that if his premises be admitted, his conclusion is
irresistible; and that <span class='it'>he</span> did not know how to gainsay the
premises.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the Hierophant, a monthly publication of which he is
editor, he enters elaborately into the nature of the prophetic
symbols, and in the last number brings out some
grand results as to the physical destiny of the globe. He
assumes that a fair construction of the language of the prophets
is far from countenancing the idle dreams of Miller
and his school respecting the literal conflagration of the
heavens and the earth, and does not even teach that such a
catastrophe is <span class='it'>ever</span> to take place. He denies not that this
<span class='it'>may</span> possibly be the finale which awaits our planet and
the solar system, but if so, it is to be gathered rather from
astronomy than revelation—from the apocalypse of Newton,
Laplace and Herschell, than from that of John.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In general literature, in science and in art, America has
furnished some of the best names in the world of letters;
but it is in theology and religious philosophy that our countrymen
have made the greatest advances. We need but
allude to Edwards, Dwight, Emmons, Marsh, Beecher,
Alexander, Stuart, McIlvaine, and Bush in proof of this.
Perhaps we may add to the list Orestes Brownson, who,
however erratic and peculiar, is a man of singular genius
and sincerity. In our endeavors to keep the readers of this
magazine advised of the condition of our literature, we
should fail of our intent if at times we did not notice books
and authors of a grave character. The useful and the true
is in every thing the national aim. The writings of which
we have spoken particularly in this brief notice, are distinguished
for remarkable directness of language and logical
clearness, as much as for profound scholarship, and they
are among the most original works of their class brought
out in our times.</p>

Compiled from Various Sources: by William McCarty.
Three volumes duodecimo. Philadelphia, W. McCarty.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. McCarty is a bookseller, of the long established house
of McCarty &amp; Davis, in Market street. He is an antiquary
also, and has in his chambers one of the best collections of
books relating to our history and antiquities to be found in
this country. Several years ago he “formed the plan of gathering
together our national songs and ballads, deeming
the task, however humble,” he says, “one of which the
result would be acceptable to his countrymen.” He has
since gleaned from all the files of magazines, newspapers
and other periodicals, in the public libraries and in his own
possession, published since Braddock’s defeat at DuQuesne,
every scrap of verse, “good, bad, or indifferent,” relating
to men, manners and events in America, and had them
printed in three neat volumes, the first of which contains
the “patriotic,” the second the “military,” and the third
the “naval.” It is certainly a very curious collection.
Some of the pieces, indeed, were written by foreigners, and
have as little relation to any thing in America as to the
quackeries of Græfenberg; and others are not decidedly
poetical; but by far the greater number belong to one or
another of the divisions in which the compiler has placed
them, and, as he well remarks, “the present and future
generations of Americans will hardly disdain those strains,
however homely, which cheered and animated our citizen
soldiers and seamen, ‘in the times that tried men’s souls,’
at the camp-fire or on the forecastle.” We perceive that
Mr. McCarty has copied from our Magazine for October most
of the pieces included in the article on “The Minstrelsy of
the Revolution.” We have many others not embraced in
his volumes, of which we intend to present a few additional
specimens to our readers, in connection, perhaps, with some
of the most curious verses in the books he has given us.</p>

volumes, duodecimo. Philadelphia, Lea &amp; Blanchard.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>We received this novel too recently to be able to do it
justice in our present number. It is a story of the sea, and
from a cursory examination we are inclined to believe it
equal to Mr. Cooper’s most celebrated naval romances.
The scene is in the Mediterranean, in the memorable years
1798 and 1799. Le Feu-Follet is a French privateer, commanded
by Raoul Yvard, a skilful, bold and chivalrous
sailor, and the interest of the tale turns principally upon
the manœuvres by which he preserves her from capture by
the English frigate Prosperine. The character second in
importance on board the republican privateer is Ithule Bolt,
a shrewd Yankee, who, impressed into the British navy,
had shared in the dangers of Nelson’s victory, and now
added to a patriotic hatred of the English, some slight ill
will created by what he deemed unjustifiable appliances of
the lash during his service on board the Prosperine. Blended
with the main narrative is a history of the loves of the commander
of Le Feu-Follet and a beautiful Italian girl,
Ghita Giuntotardi, one of our author’s most admirably
drawn heroines. Those who would know more of the plot
we refer to the book itself, or to the Yankee lieutenant,
who in due time returned to the United Slates, married a
widow, and “settled in life” somewhere in the Granite
State. He is said at the present moment to be an active
abolitionist, a patron of the temperance cause, and a terror
to evil doers, under the appellation of Deacon Bolt. We
are pleased to learn that the publishers have fixed the price
of Wing-and-Wing at half a dollar—lower by fifty per cent.
at least than an American novel was ever sold for before.
For this reason, as well as on account of its remarkable
merit, we predict for it a sale equal to that of “The Spy,”
or “The Red Rover.”</p>

William Herbert, the author of “Cromwell,”

educated for the bar; his writings were generally on political
or sporting topics, in the daily gazettes, or the magazines.
The admirable series of papers, entitled “Fire
Island Ana,” was written for the American Monthly,
while that work was under Mr. Herbert; and most of his
later compositions appeared in the “Turf Register.” We
have not room to do them justice. They have never been
excelled in this country, in richness of humor, freshness,

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Miss Barrett.</span>—In this number will be found a series of
sonnets by Miss Elizabeth B. Barrett, among the first of her
contributions to any American periodical. They were originally
intended for “Arcturus,” to which magazine they
were sent; but arriving after the discontinuance of that
periodical, its editors placed them at our disposal, “thinking
the good company into which they would be introduced in
‘Graham,’ would be every way agreeable to the fair authoress.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Miss Barrett’s productions are unique in this age of lady
authors. They have the “touch of nature” in common
with the best; they have, too, sentiment, passion and fancy
in the highest degree, without reminding us of Mrs. Hemans,
Mrs. Norton, or L. E. L. Her excellence is her
own; her mind is colored by what it feeds on; the fine tissue
of her flowing style comes to us from the loom of Grecian
thought. She is the learned poetess of the day, familiar
with Homer and Æschylus and Sophocles, and to the musings
of Tempe she has added the inspiration of Christianity,
“above all Greek, all Roman fame.” She has translated
the Prometheus to the delight of scholars, and has lately
contributed a series of very remarkable prose papers to the
London Athenæum. Her reading Greek recalls to us
Roger Ascham’s anecdote of Lady Jane Grey; but Lady
Jane Grey has left us no such verses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A striking characteristic of Miss Barrett’s prose, is its
prevailing seriousness, approaching to solemnity—a garb
borrowed from the “sceptred pale” of her favorite Greek
drama of fate. She loses much with the general reader by
a dim mysticism; but many of her later poems are free from
any such defect. The great writers whom she loves will
teach her the plain, simple, universal language of poetry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Her dreams and abstractions, though “caviare to the
generale,” have their admirers, who will ever find in pure
and elevated philosophy expressed in the words of enthusiasm
the living presence of poetry. On Parnassus there
are many groves: far from the dust of the highway, embosomed
in twilight woods that seem to symbol Reverence
and Faith trusting on the unseen, we may hear in the whispering
of the trees, the wavering breath of insect life, the
accompaniment of our poet’s strain. Despise not dreams
and reveries. With Cowley, Miss Barrett vindicates herself.
“The father of poets tells us, even dreams, too, are from
God.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We cannot here do justice to Miss Barrett’s volume of the
Seraphim, or to her other poems. We cannot here illustrate
as we would the lofty tone of her conceptions, which
in grandeur and human interest belong to the highest and
most enduring of lyrical strains. She has thrown aside
sentimentality, the fluency without thought, the cheap eloquence
that marks a certain school of lady poets, for the
genuine language of emotion, the fire-new currency of
speech forged in the secret chambers of the heart. From
two volumes of her poetry before us, (unfamiliar as yet to
American readers—they cannot be so long,) we quote one
poem, perhaps not the most brilliant of all, but inferior to
none of the rest in the pathos, the tenderness, the deep
Christian sympathy with human life, which dwell in the
soul of this rare poetess.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>Stars that Have Set in MDCCCXLII.</span>—Among the
dead of the year now drawing to a close, America laments
her Marsh and Channing, and Europe, Sismondi and some
less brilliant luminaries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Rev. <span class='sc'>James Marsh</span>, D.D. was, at the time of his
death, the third day of July, Professor of Moral and Intellectual
Philosophy in the University of Vermont. He was
a calm, chaste scholar, an earnest and profound thinker,
and a powerful and eloquent advocate of the highest principles
of religion and philosophy, with the perfect simplicity
and grandeur of whose life were blended the rarest
virtues that adorn humanity. His principal published writings,
excepting a few articles in the leading reviews, and
some translations from the German, are devoted to those
high and spiritual principles of philosophy, of which Coleridge
and Kant were the most celebrated European exponents.
We are pleased to learn that Professor Torrey, one
of the dearest friends of the departed, is now superintending
the publication of a complete edition of his works.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The name of <span class='sc'>William Ellery Channing</span> has been long
familiar to the readers of America and Great Britain. He
was equally popular in both countries, and in both was
regarded as one of the greatest authors of the age. The
first edition of his collected writings we believe was published
some five or six years since in Glasgow, and the last,
in six octavo volumes, in Boston, in the winter of 1840.
We presume his later productions, unprinted sermons, etc.—sufficient
to fill several additional volumes—will soon
be published, with his memoirs. Doctor <span class='sc'>Channing</span> was
for a long period the leading divine of the Unitarian belief,
and though an ardent controvertist, was regarded by all
men with love and reverence. The purity of his life, his
high aims, his candor, and the dignity and beauty of his diction,
won for him a reputation that will endure when
most of the names now prominent in the world of letters
are forgotten. He died in Bennington, in Vermont, on his
return way from an excursion among the Green Mountains
in search of health, on the second day of October.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>John Charles Leonard de Sismondi</span> was one of the
most celebrated historical, political and æsthetical writers
of the time. He died near Geneva, on the twenty-fifth of
June, in his sixty-ninth year. He was the author of New
Principles of Political Economy, A History of the Italian
Republics, A History of the Literature of Southern Europe,
A History of France, Julia Severn, a romance, and several
other works, making in the aggregate about one hundred
and fifty volumes, in the French editions. As a
historian he has rarely been surpassed, and in every department
of letters he exercised a powerful influence for
nearly half a century.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. <span class='sc'>James Grahame</span>, author of the excellent History of
the United Slates which bears his name; Sir <span class='sc'>Robert Kerr
Porter</span>, the traveler; <span class='sc'>Theodore E. Hook</span>, the novelist,
biographer, and dramatic writer; and <span class='sc'>Robert Mudie</span>,
author of several works on natural history, etc. were better
known in this country than any of the other literary characters
who have died in Europe during the present year.</p>

<hr class='tbk143'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>New Books.</span>—We received several new works too late
to be noticed properly in our present number, of which we
have space to mention particularly only Mr. <span class='sc'>Norman’s</span>
“Rambles in Yucatan,” and Mr. <span class='sc'>Lester’s</span> observations
on “The Condition and Fate of England,” both from the
press of Messrs. Langley, of New York. The first is an
exceedingly interesting work, and the last quite as good as
the same author’s “Glory and Shame of England.” We
shall endeavor to do them full justice in our Magazine for
January.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The End of the Year.</span>—With the present number we
bring to a close another year of the publication of <span class='sc'>Graham’s
Magazine</span>. The many improvements which since our last
anniversary have been effected in the work, and the extraordinary
accessions to our subscription list—between
twenty and thirty thousand in twelve months!—impart to
us a satisfaction which we trust is shared in some degree
by our million readers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the commencement of the present year, <span class='sc'>Rufus W.
Griswold</span> has become associated with the proprietor in
the editorship of the Magazine; and to our corps of contributors
have been added <span class='sc'>William C. Bryant</span> and <span class='sc'>Richard
H. Dana</span>, the first American poets, and the equals of
any now living in the world; <span class='sc'>James Fenimore Cooper</span>,
the greatest of living novelists; <span class='sc'>Charles F. Hoffman</span>, one
of the most admired poets and prose writers of our country;
<span class='sc'>Elizabeth B. Barrett</span>, the truest female poet who has
written in the English language; <span class='sc'>J. H. Mancur</span>, the author
of “Henri Quatre;” <span class='sc'>George H. Colton</span>, the author of
“Tecumseh;” <span class='sc'>H. T. Tuckerman</span>, the author of “Isabelle, or
Sicily,” etc.; the author of “A New Home” and “Forest
Life,” who, under the name of “<span class='it'>Mary Clavers</span>,” has won a
reputation second to that of none of the writers of her sex in
America; Mrs. <span class='sc'>E. F. Ellet</span>, the well known author of
“The Characters of Schiller,” etc.; Mrs. <span class='sc'>Seba Smith</span>,
whose elegant and truthful compositions are as universally
admired as they are read; and several others, whom we
have not now space to mention. All these, with our favorite
old writers, Professor <span class='sc'>Longfellow</span>, <span class='sc'>George Hill</span>,
<span class='sc'>Edgar A. Poe</span>, Mrs. <span class='sc'>Embury</span>, Mrs. <span class='sc'>Stephens</span>, and others,
we shall retain for our succeeding volumes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We shall likewise receive regular contributions during
the ensuing year, from <span class='sc'>N. P. Willis</span>, whose many admirable
qualities as a writer have made his name familiar
wherever English literature is read; <span class='sc'>T. C. Grattan</span>,
the popular author of “Highways and Byways,” “The
Heiress of Bruges,” etc.; “<span class='it'>Maria del Occidente</span>,” the
author of “Zophiel,” and many others, whose names will
from month to month grace our pages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let our Past speak for our Future. The improvements
made in <span class='sc'>Graham’s Magazine</span>, in 1842, will be surpassed
by those that we shall introduce in 1843. In all the departments
of our work we shall remain in advance of every
other candidate for the public favor.</p>

<hr class='tbk144'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>The Author of the Sketch Book.</span>—In a notice of the
Miscellanies of Sir Walter Scott, in the number of this
Magazine for September, we made allusion to reviews of
various publications of Mr. Washington Irving, which we
had good reason for believing were written by that gentleman
himself. We learn with pleasure, from one who
speaks on the subject by authority, that Mr. Irving is guiltless
of the imputed self laudation. He did indeed write the
article in the London Quarterly on his “Chronicles of
Grenada,” and received for it the sum we mentioned; but,
like so many of the modern “reviews,” it had very little
relation to the work which gave it a title, or to its author.</p>

<hr class='tbk145'/>

<p class='pindent'><span class='sc'>H. Hastings Weld.</span>—We notice that this talented and
agreeable writer, formerly editor of the Brother Jonathan,
has taken the editorial charge of the <span class='sc'>United States Saturday
Post</span>, a family newspaper of the largest class and
circulation. We feel assured that the humor and vivacity
of Mr. Weld’s pen will tend to make the paper still more
popular, and to add greatly to the already enormous subscription
list. This paper already circulates more copies
weekly than any other family newspaper in the Union.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
